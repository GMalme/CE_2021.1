AB The Paso Del Norte region includes El Paso County (Texas), Dona Ana County (New Mexico), and Ciudad Juarez (Mexico) along the southwest border region between the United States and Mexico. With a combined population of more than 2 million, the city of El Paso (Texas) and Ciudad Juarez have an intertwined transportation system with one of the nation's busiest international borders. In response to growing transportation needs in this binational region, the Texas Transportation Institute established a new transportation research center in the city of El Paso. One of the many research initiatives identified at the early stages of the center's inception was to develop a mobility information system for the Paso Del Norte region. The goals of this regional mobility information system were to demonstrate the significance and benefits of archiving intelligent transportation system (ITS) data, build a centralized repository of transportation data, provide the ability to monitor regional and cross-border mobility, and provide a platform to adopt newer ITS technologies. The objectives of the regional mobility information system are to provide archived transportation data user services and an advanced traveler information system in the region. The regional mobility information system is the first of its kind in the region and has been well received by stakeholder agencies. The system has an extremely flexible and scalable database framework and uses the concept of data warehouse and database-centric architecture. As an advanced traveler information system, the system provides access to users' information related to everyday travel through a single-window website.

DE advanced traveler information systems; traffic assignment
ID TRAFFIC CONGESTION; TIME
AB The goal of this paper is to develop a framework for evaluating the effect of Advanced Traveler Information Systems. The framework uses a composite traffic assignment model which combines a probabilistic traveler behavior model of route diversion and a queuing model to evaluate Advanced Traveler Information Systems impacts under incident conditions. The composite assignment model considers three types of travelers: those who are unequipped with electronic devices, i.e. they do not have Advanced Traveler Information Systems or radio in their vehicles; those who receive delay information from radio only; and those who access Advanced Traveler Information Systems only. The unequipped travelers are able to observe incident-induced congestion, if the congestion reaches or exceeds their decision point. The composite model assigns travelers with Advanced Traveler Information Systems to the shortest travel time route. Travelers with radio information and those who can observe the congestion are assigned according to a behavioral model calibrated on revealed preference data. Travelers who are completely unaware of the incident-induced congestion are assigned to their usual route. The unique feature of the composite model is the integration of realistic traveler behavior with system performance while accounting for the effect of real-time travel information. To demonstrate the application of the composite model, we consider the evolution of queues on a two link network with an incident bottleneck. The findings indicate that the overall system performance, measured by average travel time, improves marginally with increased market penetration of Advanced Traveler Information Systems. However, the benefits of Advanced Traveler Information Systems under incident conditions are expected to be marginal when there is more 'information' available to travelers through their own observation or radio. Specifically, delay information received through radio and from observation of incident-induced congestion induces people to divert earlier causing the network to operate closer to system optimal than user equilibrium. This limits the potential benefits of Advanced Traveler Information Systems. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The emergence of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has fostered the development of advanced traveler information systems (ATIS). These systems are designed to assist travelers in making pre-trip and enroute travel choice decisions. It is contended that while many traveler information systems are innovative and make use of cutting edge technologies, they lack real machine intelligence and therefore may be limited in their ability to service the traveling public over the long-run. The purpose of this paper is to present a vision of the next generation traveler information system, termed Intelligent Traveler Information Systems (ITIS) in which artificial intelligence techniques are drawn upon to create systems capable of providing travelers with more personalized planning assistance.

AB The present article dwells upon the Information System (IS) of Latvian railways providing the analysis of the queuing system (QS) used to removing defects occurring in the infinite linear queuing system. The author of the article analyzes research data about the failures of system functioning in order to establish the parameters of the before mentioned system and other information systems used by Latvian railways.
   The structure of accidents happening in the informative systems and the removal of possible defects are researched. The present investigation provides evidence that substantiates a Markov hypothesis about the peculiarities of IS service.
   The author also examines the organizational structure of IS taking into consideration the level of the danger of possible accidents. The statistics of the failures of IS relates to the statistics of accidents that might happen to rolling stock.

AB The adoption of inventory management practices and their relationship with the enterprise-wide adoption of information systems are empirically evaluated. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses of survey responses indicate a strong enterprise-wide emphasis on materials requirements planning (MRP)-and just-in-time (JIT)-based inventory management systems as well as a continued relevancy of the economic order quantity model. Furthermore, the investigation suggests a positive correspondence between enterprise-wide information systems and MRP adoption and a negative correspondence between enterprise-wide information systems and JIT adoption.

AB This article presents a simulation-based framework to model the potential benefits from dynamic vehicle on-line routing in a distributed traffic information system based upon a vehicle-to-vehicle information-sharing architecture. Within this framework, certain vehicles with specific inter-vehicle communication equipment in the traffic network are capable of autonomous traffic surveillance and peer- to- peer information sharing. Based on real-time and historical traffic information, they independently optimize their routes, forming a self- organizing traffic information overlay to the existing vehicular roadway network. In-trip rerouting decisions arising from drivers' interactions with this distributed information system are modeled according both to a rational-boundary model and to a binary-logit model under the assumption that each driver is a rational entity. A path-based microscopic traffic simulation model is developed to study on-line vehicle navigation in the distributed traffic information system, testing nonrecurrent congestion cases on two different networks representing typical roadway scenarios in daily commuting. Based on simulation study results, potential benefits both for travelers with access to the traffic information system as well as for the traffic system as a whole are demonstrated.

AB As traffic congestion continues to grow on our roadway systems, trip travel times are becoming less consistent and less predictable. To help travelers plan trips better, traffic information systems are becoming increasingly valuable. These traffic information systems can be used off board (e.g., on the Internet before trip departure) or on board; several navigation systems exist that can provide real-time traffic information. Most traffic information systems are based on a centralized architecture focused on a traffic management center (TMC) that collects, processes, and disseminates traffic data. As an alternative approach, there has been recent interest in decentralized traffic information systems, that is, those that are based on intervehicle communications (IVC). As IVC-equipped vehicles travel the roadways, they can share information on network traffic conditions, and regional traffic information can soon be established. Decentralized systems avoid potential single-point failures that a TMCbased system might have and are capable of covering roadways that do not have embedded loop detectors. Several techniques are investigated on the way traffic information can be collected, processed, and shared in a decentralized IVC-based traffic information system. These techniques vary from simple blind averaging between all participating vehicles, to more sophisticated techniques using decay factors or filtered estimation. Simulation experiments have been carried out with the use of a unique integrated vehicle-traffic-network-communication tool to analyze the efficacy of decentralized IVC-based traffic information systems, on which each estimation technique has been rigorously evaluated.

AB The improvement of logistics operation management for many tobacco companies highly depends on the reduction of distribution costs. In order to optimize routes, cigarettes are delivered through online real-time distribution system equipped with GIS/GPS. These network information technologies are crucial to creating and maintaining an efficient distribution system. Considering the applicability and flexibility of GIS/GPS network information system, this paper assesses the impact of its implementation on the logistics distribution cost from both overall and household levels. Specifically, DID and pseudo-DID models were adopted and monthly panel data of 14 prefecture-level branches of Hunan Tobacco Company during 2016-2019 were used for regression.We find that the implementation of GIS/GPS network information systems increased the total distribution cost. However, the average distribution cost was significantly reduced at per household level as the customer base expanded. A series of robustness and sensitivity tests supported above results. Furthermore, the implementation of GIS/GPS network information system is beneficial to service quality and employee performance. In addition, more time and logistics costs were saved when drivers chose ?dynamic + fixed optimization? route model.

AB A modeling framework is developed to assess the performance of driver information systems. The two main components of the framework are a route choice module and a traffic simulation module. In the route choice module, three types of driver information systems are studied: the pretrip information service, the in-car route guidance system, and the variable message signs. The traffic simulation module controls the dynamics in a road network as traffic evolves over time in response to driver information. The dynamic properties of the framework are demonstrated in a test network and a simplified Singapore road network. The results suggest that there could be an optimal level of subscription to driver information or market penetration. Subscription to real-time driver information services is recommended, but a high level of subscription may result in extra delay. Variable message signs are not as effective as either pretrip information or in-car route guidance at their respective optimal levels of market penetration.

AB This article presents a Web-based transit information system design that uses Internet Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies to integrate Web serving, GIS processing, network analysis and database management. A path finding algorithm for transit network is proposed to handle the special characteristics of transit networks, e.g., time-dependent services, common bus lines on the same street, and non-symmetric routing with respect to an origin/destination pair. The algorithm takes into account the overall level of services and service schedule on a route to determine the shortest path and transfer points. A framework is created to categorize the development of transit information systems on the basis of content and functionality, from simple static schedule display to more sophisticated real time transit information systems. A unique feature of the reported Web-based transit information system is the Internet-GIS based system with an interactive map interface. This enables the user to interact with information on transit routes, schedules, and trip itinerary planning. Some map rendering, querying, and network analysis functions are also provided.

AB The advanced traveler information system (ATIS) is a type of intelligent transportation system application areas that implements emerging computer, communication, and information technologies to provide vital information to the users of a system regarding traffic regulation, route and location guidance, hazardous situations and safety advisory, and warning messages. ATIS requires a large amount of data for processing, analysis, and storage for effective dissemination of traveler information to users. A geographical information system (GIS) allows large data to be effectively processed, stored, analyzed, logically associated, and graphical displayed. Thus, GIS-based ATIS provides a convenient and powerful tool for storage and graphical representation of information, which can be useful users. Further, by availing the powerful GIS functionalities, a user can conceive a problem and allow the appropriate software to assist him in the decision-making process regarding optimum route selection and trip planning. In this paper, the authors present a GIS-based ATIS for Hyderabad City, India. Development of this GIS-based ATIS has been carried under the ArcView GIS environment. This user-friendly system provides comprehensive information about Hyderabad City, such as road networks, hospitals, government and private offices, stadiums, bus and railway stations, and tourist places within the city limits. This system can be used effectively in bus stations, railway stations, airports, and tourist information centers, as well as in personal computers to provide information to travelers and to facilitate travel.

AB The resource wastage in supply chains may be reduced by proper supply chain integration (SCI). SCI may be able to provide the additional means in assuring economic growth while protecting the environment. The hauliers provide the primary linkage between shippers and consignees and logistics service providers in the inland container supply chain. This empirical investigation aims to ascertain the supply environment factors and information system which affect SCI and whether SCI affect operational and environmental performance. Data collected from 110 haulier companies were analysed using partial least squares, structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) methodology. Supply environment which represents transaction attributes affects SCI which in turn positively affects operational and environmental performance. Information system reduces information asymmetry between transacting organizations and by this, moderate the effect of supply environment on SCI. Results provide evidence that SCI is dependent on the context of the supply environment. Opportunistic behavior due to information asymmetry could also be curtailed by proper information system. Therefore, practitioners and stakeholders need to align SCI to the context of supply environment to reap the maximum benefit of SCI. Concurrently, opportunistic behavior needs to be curtailed in supply chain to improve operational and environmental performance.

AB A study of the usability of statewide web-based traveler information systems was conducted to assess their effectiveness in conveying, road and weather information to travelers. Guidelines from traveler information systems and the website design literature were coalesced to create an assessment framework to include important elements from a user's perspective. Ninety-eight travelers from the State College, Pennsylvania, area visited web-based roadway weather information systems;for Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio as part of a laboratory-based trip-planning experiment and provided ratings of site attributes. Site ratings revealed that it was important that travelers accessed information about conditions along their intended route with minimal. searching. Map scale and resolution were important graphical elements. The most relevant weather information elements identified by users were precipitation type, road surface condition, visibility, and air temperature.

TI Expanding the Road Weather Information System for Avalanche Support
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Transportation agencies use road weather information systems to support operations, maintenance, and informed travel decisions. Road weather capabilities have been expanded through the FHWA Weather Responsive Traffic Management's advisory, control, and treatment strategies to address weather-related roadway impacts. Monitoring conditions that precede avalanches offers a new opportunity to leverage the road weather information system's infrastructure. Wet avalanches, particularly wet slab avalanches, pose considerable risk. They can occur simultaneously across an extensive area, encompass a greater mass of material, create considerable energy, cause significant road closures, and lead to major injuries and fatalities. Roadside and at-altitude avalanche indicators can be monitored by adding sensors to existing road weather environmental sensor stations, deploying new environmental sensor stations at both roadside and at-altitude locations, and creating new, collaborative partnerships. The traditional sensor suite of the road weather information system can be augmented with new meteorological and snowpack sensors to monitor preavalanche conditions. Calibrated present weather detector sensors and heated precipitation gauges can provide improved estimates of the precipitation's liquid water equivalent. Thermistor strings and lysimeters can provide snowpack stability evaluations. Adding environmental sensor stations, both at roadside and at altitude, can provide strategic observations of the atmospheric and snowpack conditions. Increased coordination between agencies on site selection, sensor choices, and data distribution can expand the role of road weather information systems to support avalanche forecasting.

TI Statistical analysis of commercial driver and dispatcher requirements

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper analyzes the responses from two nationwide surveys designed to obtain user information requirements for the design of advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) and commercial vehicle operations (CVO) with respect to commercial system operators (dispatchers) and commercial vehicle drivers. A total of 673 returned surveys (348 dispatcher surveys and 325 commercial driver surveys), were used in the analysis. Mathematical models were developed, using a binomial legit to predict whether the commercial driver or dispatcher would use an intelligent transportation system, and an ordered probit to estimate the importance of information (i.e. route and navigation, roadside services, personal communication and road and traffic information) to be provided by in-vehicle information systems. The results of this study provide guidelines for the design of information systems and help define informational requirements for users of ATIS/CVO.

AB As a subsystem of an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), an Advanced Traveller Information System (ATIS) disseminates real-time traffic information to travellers. To help them with making better decisions on choosing their routes, a strong need to predict traffic congestion and to disseminate the predicted congestion information relating to travellers can be seen. This paper describes a methodology used by drivers for calculating an optimal driven route in Vilnius. The paper discusses how ATIS systems will likely evolve the experience of Information Service Providers (ISP) and optimal route planning calculations. A few methods of route planning have been taken into account. The paper presents the following types of route calculation: 1) the shortest route; 2) the quickest route; 3) the quickest forecasted route according to historical traffic information. Also, the paper deals with the architecture of the WEB based information system for drivers in Vilnius and analyzes data on traffic workflow. Furthermore, a comprehensive route planning procedure that forecasts data on driving time considering historical traffic is followed.

AB Intermodal transport can reduce the load of the road infrastructure. Knowledge gives it the necessary competitiveness and helps to control its costs. Fast reaction to changing conditions, opportunities and requirements gives remarkable advantage. Setting up integrated logistic chains using alternative transport modes requires the trust and close interaction of a variety of actors involved in managing the chain. Especially in the dynamic mobile environment, knowledge has so far not been effectively used. FREIGHTWISE tackles this complexity by developing a framework architecture anchored and validated in a range demonstration cases involving commercial and public actors. This paper discusses the general FREIGHTWISE objectives and its North-East Case, the Logistiikkainfo goods transport service network information system to be implemented for the Estonian - Finnish transport chain.

AB Driver information systems (DIS) are considered in North America as a major category of Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems (IVHS), which offers to improve the efficiency and safety of driving by means of an amalgamation of information technology with vehicle and highway technologies.  Traditionally North America has basic strengths in a number of information technologies that are relevant to DIS.  Due to a hiatus in federal funding in the early 1980s, DIS development in North America during the past decade has emphasized autonomous systems on the vehicles until recently.  The current acceleration of IVHS development in the United States has resulted from a number of converging forces and has provided the impetus for developing advanced driver information systems (ADIS) that integrates the vehicle and the highway.  Large-scale demonstration and implementation of AIDS will hinge on the major legislations in the near future, and on the successful development of public-private sector partnerships in IVHS.

AB After the widespread deployment of Advanced Traveler Information Systems, there exists an increasing concern about their profitability. The costs of such systems are clear, but the quantification of the benefits still generates debate. This paper analyzes the value of highway travel time information systems. This is achieved by modeling the departure time selection and route choice with and without the guidance of an information system. The behavioral model supporting these choices is grounded on the expected utility theory, where drivers try to maximize the expected value of their perceived utility. The value of information is derived from the reduction of the unreliability costs as a consequence of the wiser decisions made with information. This includes the reduction of travel times, scheduling costs and stress. This modeling approach allows assessing the effects of the precision of the information system in the value of the information.
   Different scenarios are simulated in a generic but realistic context, using empirical data measured on a highway corridor accessing the city of Barcelona, Spain. Results show that travel time information only has a significant value in three situations: (1) when there is an important scheduled activity at the destination (e.g. morning commute trips), (2) in case of total uncertainty about the conditions of the trip (e.g. sporadic trips), and (3) when more than one route is possible. Information systems with very high precision do not produce better results. However, an acceptable level of precision is completely required, as information systems with very poor precision may even be detrimental. The paper also highlights the difference between the user value and the social value of the information. The value of the information may not benefit only the user. For instance, massive dissemination of travel time information contributes to the reduction of day-to-day travel time variance. This favors all drivers, even those without information. In these situations travel time information has the property that its social benefits exceed private benefits (i.e. information has positive externalities). Of course, drivers are only willing to cover costs equal or smaller than their private benefits, which in turn may justify subsidies for information provision. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB A sample of travelers' preferences toward in-vehicle traffic information systems was undertaken and appropriate statistical models were estimated. Specifically, ordered legit and regression analyses were conducted to quantify travelers' ratings of the importance of in-vehicle system attributes, and the distance ahead that they prefer to be notified of various types of information provided by in-vehicle systems. Model estimation results show that travelers' socio-economics, habitual travel patterns, commute congestion levels and attitudes toward in-vehicle technologies are significant determinants of travelers' importance ratings and the preferred distance ahead of in-vehicle system information. These model results provide important information for both marketing and design of in-vehicle information systems.

TI Evaluation of mobility impacts of advanced information systems
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE

DT Article
AB Advanced technologies under the aegis of advanced traveler information systems and advanced traffic management systems are being employed to address the debilitating traffic congestion problem. Broadly identified under the label intelligent transportation systems (ITS), they focus on enhancing the efficiency of the existing roadway utilization. Though ITS has transitioned from the conceptual framework stage to the operational test phase that analyzes real-world feasibility, studies that systematically quantify the multidimensional real-world impacts of these technologies in terms of mobility, safety, and air quality, are lacking. This paper proposes a simulation-based framework to address the mobility impacts of these technologies through the provision of information to travelers. The information provision technologies are labeled as advanced information systems (AIS), and include pretrip information, en route information, variable message signs, and combinations thereof. The primary focus of the paper is to evaluate alternative AIS technologies using the heavily traveled Borman Expressway corridor in northwestern Indiana as a case study. Simulation results provide insights into the mobility impacts of AIS technologies, and contrast the effectiveness of alternative information provision sources and strategies.

AB Traffic information systems have to process and analyze huge amounts of data in real-time to effectively provide traffic information to road users. Progress in mobile communication technology with higher bandwidths and lower latencies enables the use of data provided by in-car sensors. Data stream management systems have been proposed to address the challenges of such applications which have to process a continuous data flow from various data sources in real-time. Data mining methods, adapted to data streams, can be used to analyze the data and to identify interesting patterns such as congestion or road hazards. Although several data stream mining methods have been proposed, an evaluation of such methods in the context of traffic applications is yet missing. In this paper, we present an evaluation framework for traffic information systems based on data streams. We apply a traffic simulation software to emulate the generation of traffic data by mobile probes. The framework is applied in two case studies, namely queue-end detection and traffic state estimation. The results show which parameters of the traffic information system significantly impact the accuracy of the predicted traffic information. This provides important findings for the design and implementation of traffic information systems using data from mobile probes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, spatio-temporal data analytics plays an important role in different applications based on geographic information system (GIS). One of such applications is emergency management information systems (EMISs) which process a huge amount of spatio-temporal data that can be considered as Big Data (BD). Effective EMIS data analysis will allow authorities to improve the management of emergency events, including those related to traffic problems (traffic accidents, traffic jams, etc.). However, the stack of modern technologies dealing with BD does not provide natively supported functions for spatio-temporal data analysis, so they have to be developed and implemented for EMIS. In this study, the authors developed and evaluated several algorithms and a framework for big spatio-temporal data mining in the Russian EMIS GLONASS + 112112. They suggested improved spatio-temporal co-location patterns mining technique based on DBSCAN, FPGrowth, and natural language processing (NLP). They detected spatio-temporal outliers and spatial autocorrelation. Finally, they evaluated the scalability and time performance of algorithms. They found that using NLP and aggregation of an emergency dataset with weather to enhance the number of emergency categories could significantly increase the quality of association rules. They discovered valuable association rules related to traffic accidents in the dedicated area of Kazan city.

AB Real-time transit passenger information systems are intended to improve the level of service provided by transit agencies. For example, passengers are given real-rime information on the expected arrival times of buses on various routes at bus stops. These real-time systems reflect emerging applications in public transit, and methods to evaluate their benefits are limited. An evaluation method is presented that focuses on the potential benefits of bus arrival information systems to passengers waiting at bus stops. Passenger arrivals and transit bus operations are modeled as a stochastic system in which the operator uses real-time bus location data to provide bus arrival-time information that maximizes passengers' utilities. Simulation results reveal the nature of the dependence of system benefits on the type of real-time data available to the operator and the bus operations characteristics. An application to an existing bus transit system demonstrates the feasibility of the developed method and its role in assessing the value of real-time bus arrival information systems to passengers.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper is concerned with the effect of linking innovative bus-control systems with real-time passenger information, with the overall aim of improving conditions for bus operation and passengers in central urban corridors.
   The first section presents a concise review of bus passenger information systems (particularly their application at bus stops). Then the concept of real-time passenger information is explored. The case for and against real-time information is argued and two British case-studies follow. In the second section it is argued that the provision of real-time information, as part of an integrated bus-control/information system, offers new possibilities for meeting the identified needs of public transport users. Finally, in the third section, some comments are made on the evaluation of different combinations of bus-control and passenger information tested using a simulation method and a series of subjective response surveys. General relationships governing the degree of bus-control required and the extent of information needed are of special interest.

AB The paper describes the facilities of a new application serving for entering railway undertakings requirements related to train tracks in the conditions of the Czech Republic. The application is a part of a new information system of the train timetables configuration. The train editor represents a distributed application consisting of a database server, application server and a client program. It contains most of the data of trains available in the programming schedule. In addition to features for working with trains, it provides a variety of analytical tools and printing of tools for railway workers and passengers. In order to coordinate compiling of the timetable by the infrastructure manager, a train-making procedure was designed based on the stages of the train.

DE inter-vehicle communication; self-organizing; simulation; ad hoc
   networks; information propagation
AB This paper investigates the feasibility of a self-organizing, completely distributed traffic information system based upon vehicle-to-vehicle communication technologies. Unlike centralized traffic information systems, the proposed system does not need public infrastructure investment as a prerequisite for implementation. Due to the complexity of the proposed system, simulation is selected as the primary approach in the feasibility studies. A simulation framework is built based on an existing microscopic traffic simulation model for the simulation studies. The critical questions for building the proposed market-driven system are examined both from communication requirements and traffic engineering points of view. Traffic information propagation both in freeway and arterial networks via information exchange among IVC-equipped vehicles is tested within the simulation framework. Results on the probability of successful IVC and traffic information propagation distance obtained from the simulation studies are generated and analyzed under incident-free and incident conditions for various roadway formats and parameter combinations. Comparisons between the speed of the incident information wave and the speed of the corresponding traffic shock wave due to the incident are analyzed for different scenarios as the most crucial aspect of the information propagation as a potential foundation for application in such a decentralized traffic information system.

TI Research to Production Lessons Learned from an Innovative Information

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The development and delivery of large-scale, complex information systems is difficult, resulting in a low success rate industry-wide. Most production information systems are developed with the use of atop-down approach often called the waterfall model. In developing a complex information system, many variables must be considered and many potential solutions evaluated simultaneously; a linear approach is not conducive to this activity. Also, projects of this scale and complexity can be disruptive and unmanageable in a production environment. The research and development (R&D) environment is better suited to address the challenges presented by these kinds of projects. Development and transfer should not be considered separately, because the former will have a significant effect on the latter. Development in an R&D environment can provide important advantages for ensuring a successful transfer. A real-world case study of transferring an archived data management system from research to production is used to highlight the issues involved and the solutions required to effect the transition. It considers timing and method, emphasizing and detailing important areas of focus for the project partners. Lessons learned from examining this transfer process can benefit researchers, information technology and transportation professionals, and others who are or will he involved in developing information systems.

AB This study proposes a behavioural intention model that integrates information quality, response time, and system accessibility into the original technology acceptance model (TAM) to investigate whether system characteristics affect the adoption of Web-based advanced traveller information systems (ATIS). This study empirically tests the proposed model using data collected from an online survey of Web-based advanced traveller information system users. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to examine the reliability and validity of the measurement model, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to evaluate the structural model. The results indicate that three system characteristics had indirect effects on the intention to use through perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and attitude toward using. Information quality was the most important system characteristic factor, followed by response time and system accessibility. This study presents implications for practitioners and researchers, and suggests directions for future research.

AB Advanced traveller information systems (ATIS) are likely to exhibit significant economies of scale in production and operation. Private provision would therefore typically occur under considerable market power. An important policy question is whether the resulting distortions would aggravate or reduce distortions in the transport market itself, notably external effects such as congestion. We consider such questions by presenting an integrated model that captures the interactions between a congested transport market and a monopolistic market for advanced traveller information systems (ATIS). Three market failures operate simultaneously: congestion on the road, a declining average benefit of information when information penetration rises, and monopolistic pricing by the provider of information. Some key results are as follows. Monopoly information pricing appears not to be the most attractive option from a system efficiency viewpoint. A subsidy in the information market can help realise a second-best optimum of road use. Relatively low uncertainty on the road and high information costs limit the monopolist's profit on the information market, as well as relative system efficiency. While relatively inelastic demand for mobility, counter intuitively, negatively affects the monopolist's profit, the relative social benefits from private information peak at intermediate demand elasticities.

AB Autonomous vehicle traffic information systems are an important research direction for next-generation traffic information systems. Existing centralized traffic information systems involve a large initial investment and high operating costs. Furthermore, they suffer from the following problems: the need to communicate large amounts of data, requiring a longer time for road network coverage, unsteady transmission, and the need for an automatic generation and update method for road network congestion information in a large-scale urban road network. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes an intelligent vehicular traffic information system (IVTIS) based on a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). This system employs a local road network and rapid dissemination model (IVTIS-LNFRN) of congestion information based on link nodes for a large-scale urban road network, and it constructs the corresponding system models. We then use traffic simulation software to evaluate the feasibility of the IVTIS. In particular, we investigate the collection, diffusion, and dissemination of congestion information and the automatic generation and update effect of road network congestion information. Furthermore, we analyze the dissemination effect of different traffic inflow volumes, information packet loss rates, and different rates of IVTIS vehicles. The simulation results show that the proposed system has good autonomy and overall performance in terms of the real-time collection and rapid dissemination of congestion information in a large-scale urban road network.

DT Article
AB An immersive video system that has been developed for the purpose of evaluating future traveller information system (F-TIS), in particular, F-TIS scenarios that rely on a pervasive computing infrastructure is presented. Immersive video uses multiple video streams captured from a first person perspective at key locations in a scenario. By dynamically reconstructing a user's visual and aural experiences, the immersive video system creates a lab-based framework that captures a number of contextual factors of real-world mobile information system use. Graphical user interfaces, displayed on a wearable display and a personal digital assistant, are used in the evaluation. Both the technical basis of the immersive video system and its application to the study of user perceptions and reactions to pervasive information services are presented.

AB With the advancement of intelligent transportation systems, current and future emergency medical services systems are and will be characterized by real-time response, specialization, and decentralization. To provide a real-time response of medical services, several components are essential, such as dispatching, routing, emergency facilities, and patient's medical history. A common object request broker architecture (CORBA)-based geographic information system for a transportation framework is proposed for the dispatching and assignment of medical vehicles for emergency services via wireless communication. The framework combines distributed object computing, geographic information systems for transportation, and transportation models in a single system, which provides flexibility and interoperability among existing medical service systems. The framework uses the concept of distributed systems and capabilities of CORBA to design objects and dynamically update medical facilities' information to relay up-to-date information to ambulances. A real roadway network is used in the numerical experiments to illustrate dynamic aspects of the proposed system.

AB Due to the increase in vehicle transit and congestion in road networks, providing information about the state of the traffic to commuters has become a critical issue for Advanced Traveller Information Systems. These systems should assist users in making pre-trip and en-route decisions and, for this purpose, delivering travel time information is very useful because it is very intuitive and easily understood by all travellers. The aim of this paper is to present a global view of the literature on the modelling of travel time, introducing essential concepts and giving a thorough classification of the existing techniques. Most of the attention will focus on travel time estimation and travel time prediction, which are two of the most relevant challenges in travel time modelling. The definition and goals of these two modelling tasks along with the methodologies used to carry them out will be further explored and categorised.

AB To mitigate and address climate change, greener transportation modes and mobility services are in great need. Although Green Information Systems (Green IS)-specifically designed to increase environmental sustainability-can support behavioral changes, there is limited research on whether Green IS usage coincides with sustainable real-world behavior. Against this background, we combine the Theory of Planned Behavior with the Technology Acceptance Model to study the interplay of employees' Green IS usage and actual real-world behavior. Specifically, we surveyed 211 employees of a larger Western European company in the context of a recently introduced company-wide mobile application for business trip ridesharing. We conclude that Green IS can facilitate sustainable mobility adoption; however, not only technology acceptance needs to be considered but also employees' attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control regarding their business travel modes. Thus, decision-making in analog and digital realms coincide and ought to be considered in parallel.

TI Spatial Analysis of Maritime Accidents Using the Geographic Information
   System
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Despite the tremendous efforts of maritime organizations to achieve a safe and secure maritime transportation system, the losses through maritime accidents and incidents are still increasing. This paper analyzes the spatial distribution of maritime accidents occurring from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2011, based on the Marine Casualties and Incidents module of the Global Integrated Shipping Information System. The geographic information system, an effective and efficient tool for spatial analysis with high visualization, is used to carry out the analysis. Hot-spot analysis of maritime accidents identifies the hot spots. Buffer analysis is used to calculate accidents that occurred in coastal areas. Finally, the following two important results are obtained from the analysis. First, the identification of hot spots reveals the area around the United Kingdom as the area with the greatest number of accidents and the coastal areas around East Asian countries (such as China, Japan, and South Korea) and the Mediterranean Sea as the areas with the next highest number of accidents. These results compare well with a previously published paper. Second maritime accidents may not frequently occur in the open sea; however, accidents frequently happen in coastal areas, with 51.1% of the total accidents happening within 25 ml of the continents and 62.2% within 50 ml.

TI Estimation of Lane-Level Travel Times in Vehicle-to-Vehicle and
   Vehicle-to-Infrastructure-Based Traffic Information System
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID NETWORKS
AB The recent advancement of vehicle positioning and wireless communication technologies facilitates the development of more sophisticated traffic control and information strategies. This study proposes a methodology for estimating lane-level travel times ((LTT)-T-2) under an environment referred to as V2X, which includes vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. A framework is presented for a V2X-based traffic information system that is capable of transmitting vehicle positions and speeds, which are used as inputs of the proposed methodology. A concept of establishing temporal nodes and links based on the dynamic change in traffic conditions is proposed to estimate more reliable and accurate (LTT)-T-2. VISSIM, a microscopic traffic simulator for multimodal traffic flow modeling, is used to evaluate the proposed travel time estimation method. Statistical analysis techniques including analysis of variance and a homogeneity test between data groups are adopted to derive more generalized conclusions. The evaluation results show that less than a 10% mean absolute percentage error was achievable with a 20% probe vehicle rate. It is expected that the proposed methodology will serve as a useful precursor to the development of a next-generation traffic information system in the robust wireless communications era.

AB Vehicle Information and Communication System (VICS) is starting to become practicable. The infrared system of VICS detects vehicles on the road by using optical beacons to control traffic and to supply real-time traffic information. But it needs an enormous budget because the optical beacons must be located on every lane of the road throughout the country. In this paper, we propose a traffic information system using existing LED traffic lights, and focus on its visible rays and power used for traffic control, the number and location of the traffic lights, and the movement toward LED traffic lights. We design the best service area not to interfere with other service areas and analyze its basic performance such as the suitable modulation, required SNR and the amount of receivable information.

AB Integrating a geographic information system (GIS) with an existing pavement management system such as the Texas Department of Transportation Pavement Management Information System is not as simple as merely installing a new piece of software into the existing pavement management system and then operating it. A successful GIS implementation involves not only the information technologies themselves but also other elements, such as personnel and their GIS skills, the organizational structure within which they work, and the institutional relationships that govern the management of information flow. All of these elements need to be managed in an interactive manner. GIS can serve as a platform for integrating various types of data, systems, and technologies. Because of the nature of rapid changes in GIS and related information technology, a well-developed GIS implementation plan is essential. The development of a comprehensive and practical implementation plan using GIS to enhance the pavement management practice in the Texas Department of Transportation is presented. As the basis of the implementation plan, a "three-stage implementation" concept was used to assess the current practice, define the visionary system, and identify the intermediate solutions. Also presented are several key issues and aspects important to the successful implementation of GIS for pavement management.

AB In this paper, using longitudinal data on route level monthly average weekday ridership in the entire Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) bus system from January 2002 through December 2010, we evaluate the ridership effects of the CIA real-time bus information system. This bus information system is called CIA Bus Tracker and was incrementally implemented on different CIA bus routes from August 2006 to May 2009. To take account of other factors that might affect bus ridership, we also include data on unemployment levels, gas prices, local weather conditions, transit service attributes, and socioeconomic characteristics during the study period. This combined longitudinal data source enables us to implement a quasi-experimental design with statistical controls to examine changes in monthly average weekday ridership, before and after the Bus Tracker system was implemented, on each bus route. Based on a linear mixed model, we found that the provision of Bus Tracker service does increase CIA bus ridership, although the average increase is modest. Further, the study findings suggest that there are temporal variations of the ridership effects among the routes, with the "winning" routes more likely to have the technology implemented in the later phases of the overall "roll-out" period. However, the results are less conclusive regarding geographical variations in the effects of Bus Tracker. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Information systems and technologies (IST) have been playing increasingly crucial roles in supporting the smooth running of maritime supply chain operations. The degree of acceptance of IST within the maritime sector as a whole, however, remains fragmented and variable. Some IST products and platforms have entered the market and gained a broad market share, while others are still struggling. This study, based on twenty-five cases, aims to investigate the adoption of IST in a range of organizations in the maritime shipping supply chain. Open platform, a concept first introduced by Maersk Line and IBM in 2018 for inter-organizational information sharing for the maritime supply chain, is used as an exemplar for this study. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first studies to conduct a chain-level analysis of IST adoption within the maritime transportation context. The results suggest that the adoption of inter-organizational information systems is largely affected by factors such as industry characteristics, the system's information confidentiality, supply chain trade partners' power, governmental power, and the ownership structure of the organization, among others. Furthermore, these factors have varying degrees of impact across the various organizational tiers in the maritime supply chain, e.g., information confidentiality mainly influences the adoption of forwarders. This study provides broad insights that will be of interest to both the researchers and practitioners in the maritime supply chain, in which the acceleration of digitalization is expected.

AB Advanced traveler information systems (ATISs) are continuously becoming key intelligent transportation system for disseminating valuable traveler information such as traffic, incident, and transit information. Developed countries such as the United States, Canada, Japan, U.K., Australia, and Germany have adopted ATIS expeditiously in comparison to developing countries that face considerable financial and framework constraints. Moreover, local traffic, roadway, signalization, demographic, topological, and social conditions in developing countries are quite different from those in developed countries. In this paper, a comprehensive framework comprising of system architecture, development methodology, and salient features of a developed ATIS for metropolitan cities in developing countries has been discussed. Development of proposed system is based on integration of two well-known information technologies, viz., geographic information systems and World Wide Web. Combination of these technologies can be used to develop an integrated ATIS that targets different types of travelers such as private vehicle owners, transit users, and casual outside visitors.

AB Two critical aspects related to microscopic simulation are discussed: a methodology for calibration and validation, and the integration of path dynamics modeling on large networks. These are among the most significant challenges in microscopic simulation for decision support and analysis in advanced traffic management and information systems. For calibration and validation, a distinction is made between conceptual and operational phases; the conceptual phase concerns the basic models such as car following and lane changing, and the operational phase is associated with the context of the study (origin-destination, parameters adjustments with respect to the network under study, etc.). Then a methodology is described that brings to microscopic simulation the type of capabilities for path processing and storage normally found only with macroscopic models, often because the network representation is less detailed for those. This is based on a hybrid simulation approach. An example of integrating the parallel microscopic simulation with the routing and behavior response simulation schemes, as in the dynamic network assignment simulation model for the advanced road telematics macroscopic model, is used to explain a candidate methodology to enhance microscopic models for evaluating information-routing schemes in advanced traffic management and information systems. Relevant problems faced by advanced traffic management and information systems modelers are raised that are worth further discussion; the intention is not to provide extensive results or even to answer all of the questions raised.

AB This paper describes a decision support system for transportation of hazardous materials by railway in China in order to reduce the serious consequences resulting from sudden environmental-pollution accidents. Transportation management of hazardous materials and consequent environmental risk are incorporated into the design approach for the system structure and functional framework. Moreover, management information system and geographical information system techniques are integrated for the development of system-functional modules within the decision support system. This paper mainly focuses on the datasheet construction in terms of management information system design, as well as the mathematical models applied to geographical information system buffer analysis. On completion of the system design and construction, selected functionalities of each sub-module are demonstrated. The limitation of the decision support system is also discussed, which lays a foundation for further development.

TI Effect of Real-Time Passenger Information Systems on Perceptions of
   Transit's Favorable Environmental and Traffic Reduction Roles
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB A two-wave survey of faculty, staff, and students at a large university was conducted to study the perceptions of and attitudes toward several dimensions of the university bus service before and after the implementation of a real-time passenger information system. In this study, community perceptions of the bus service's role in enhancing the environment and reducing traffic were investigated. Results showed that both users and nonusers of the bus service had positive perceptions of the bus service's environmental and traffic reduction roles, that those who noticed the recently implemented real-time information system had more positive attitudes, and that the effect of the information system on the perceptions was as great or greater for those who did not use the bus service as it was for those who used the service. It is hypothesized that these results, especially if confirmed in different communities, could motivate transit agencies to promote environmental and traffic reduction benefits of transit to gain public support of nonusers for transit subsidies and to market high-tech and progressive investments to increase support among nonusers.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB The development of the Trans-European Networks and the formulation of a common transport policy are essential elements in the economic and social development of the European Union. Such activities require significant information about current status (passenger and freight transport volumes, congestion, environmental impacts, etc.) and reliable forecasts. The relevant information exists in dispersed, heterogeneous, and autonomous databases throughout Europe, as well as in pertinent transport studies. The European Transport Information System under development is intended to support decisions on transport policies and the Trans-European Transport Networks by accommodating policy-related information in a repository that will be kept up-to-date through well-defined procedures under the control of experts and will be accessible through an Internet-based software tool. A hierarchical structure of criteria, subcriteria, indicators, and variables is used to link policy questions to relevant data sets, which are populated by collected data and statistics or alternatively by data generated through the use of models. The scope of this current work is to give an overview of the structure, functionality, and current content (data sets, variables, indicators, etc.) of the information system above.

AB Findings about the claimed use of and interest in traveler information systems among segments of the general population in the Seattle metropolitan region are reported. The research is based on data collected from a 1997 intelligent transportation system supplement to the Puget Sound Regional Council's transportation panel travel diary study. In general, interest in traffic information was found to be a function of complex travel behavior, demographics, and factors related to attitudinal and technology interest. It was also found that the potential market for advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) includes several market segments with different needs; each is drawn to ATIS for distinct and varying reasons. First, the so-called control seeker segment includes people who desire greater than average control over their environment. In a traffic information context, that translates to better knowledge of their travel times, especially in congested travel environments. The second segment of interest, dubbed webheads, includes individuals who are very comfortable with high technology, and it is possible that they would be drawn to ATIS at least partially through specific high-technology dissemination media. A third segment is made up of individuals who are less comfortable with (or less interested in) technology and are primarily interested in pretrip information, which they use to make departure time and route choice decisions.

AB The purpose of this article is to develop a framework for assessing the effects of tour information systems and information dissemination strategies by incorporating tourists' decision processes into an activity-based model. There are two important features in tourists' decision-making processes: (1) They generally have limited information and experiences on tour sites, and (2) their value of time is higher than normal travelers' because of their time limitations. These two features are, however, the main reasons that make tour information services attractive to tourists and thus should also be incorporated into a modeling framework for investigating the effects of the real-time tour information system. This study develops an agent-based simulation model that incorporates activity chaining behavior into tour scheduling systems. The underlying assumption used in the model is that tourists schedule their activities within their time and budget constraints to maximize their utilities. The model seeks individuals' optimal tour schedules by solving a prize-collecting multiple-day traveling salesman problem (PC-MD-TSP). The simulation model also includes real-time and end-of-day rescheduling capabilities by taking tourists' unpredicted delays into consideration. From a numerical test, the pros and cons of tour information services are found and the optimal strategy for a tour information service is also discussed. The results show that tour information services increase tourists' satisfaction with less expenditure by allowing tourists to visit more places in an effective way.

AB This article evaluates the potential travel time savings from Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) that provide drivers with travel time and routing information. We classify ATIS in various levels based on the type of information they use to generate guidance and the timing of the dissemination of the generated guidance to drivers. We present a case study that examines the potential travel time savings of ATIS as well as the implications on travel time variability and reliability and the sensitivity of the results to the accuracy of the information, using real-world data collected from a freeway network in Los Angeles, California.

AB Increasing smartphone penetration, combined with the wide coverage of cellular infrastructures, renders smartphone-based traffic information systems (TISs) an attractive option. The main purpose of such systems is to alleviate traffic congestion that exists in every major city. Nevertheless, to reap the benefits of smartphone-based TISs, we need to ensure their security and privacy and their effectiveness (e.g., accuracy). This is the motivation of this paper: We leverage state-of-the-art cryptographic schemes and readily available telecommunication infrastructure. We present a comprehensive solution for smartphone-based traffic estimation that is proven to be secure and privacy preserving. We provide a full-blown implementation on actual smartphones, along with an extensive assessment of its accuracy and efficiency. Our results confirm that smartphone-based TISs can offer accurate traffic state estimation while being secure and privacy preserving.

AB Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) provide comprehensive trip information for all modes of transport while considering the current traffic situation; however, impacts on travel choices are weak, which might be due to insufficient consideration of user characteristics. As a critical determinant of willingness to use, we propose and validate technophilia, an openness, interest and fascination towards information and communication technologies.
   Drawing on data from a survey of 1300 Austrians, we describe willingness to use ATIS, and delineate target groups by socio-demographic characteristics. We establish validity of a technophilia measure consisting of seven survey questions. All questions constitute a common factor (construct validity). The technophilia measure can be distinguished from social norms and. general technology-related values (discriminant validity). Technophilia is more pronounced among men, younger people, individuals with higher education and persons who frequently use the Internet for travel information or who frequently use an in-car navigation system. Among a range of potential determinants, technophilia is verified as an independent determinant of willingness to use ATIS (criterion validity).
   The results suggest to pay particular attention to the technophilia dimension in ATIS user requirements. Technophiles may advocate ATIS in their social network. The applied seven questions provide a short and valid scale of technophilia which may contribute to customer segmentation or to explaining the acceptance of traveler information.

AB Because of rapidly changing technologies and associated increasing costs, implementation of a Road/Weather Information System must be carefully planned. Planners know the importance of starting with an architecture that allows easy integration of new and legacy technologies and easy expansion to a larger system. A layered, hierarchical architecture is proposed to meet that objective. A prototype of this model was implemented in the Minnesota Department of Transportation District 1. This system is described in brief.

AB Most current research analyzing traffic crashes is done at either the spot level or the regional level. Less attention is placed at the community level. In addition, the effects of changes in land use, population growth, and transportation networks on community traffic safety have not been systematically studied. Although a number of studies have defined some variables to describe the influence of the built environment on traffic crashes, no research has looked at this problem through a comprehensive framework of relevant built-environment variables. This study explored a geographic information system-based community-level method to understand the effects of the built environment on traffic crashes. The census block group was selected as the analysis unit for the study. The framework of D transportation variables, including the dimensions of density, diversity, design, destination accessibility, and distance to transit, was used to characterize the built environment. The crash and built-environment data were processed in a geographic information system, and the negative binomial model was applied. The results showed that density had little influence on any type of crash; however, the mixed land use was positively associated with all crash categories. Furthermore, street length and number of segments under the design variables resulted in positive coefficients. However, the number of intersections was negative to all crash types. Moreover, whereas the number of bus stops showed a positive influence on crashes, the coefficient that designated the distance of crashes from bus stops and commercial sites was negative.

AB The late 1980s saw the first widespread use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in transportation research and management. Due to the specific requirements of transportation applications and of the rather late adoption of this information technology in transportation, research has been directed toward enhancing: existing GIS approaches to enable the full range of capabilities needed in transportation research and management. This paper places the concept of transportation GIS in the broader perspective of research in GIS and Geographic Information Science. The emphasis is placed on the requirements specific of the transportation domain of application of this emerging information technology as well as on core research challenges.

AB Transit Traveler Information Systems (TTIS) comprise a wide range of technologies that transit agencies use to provide reliable and timely transit-related information to customers. The touch-screen interactive information kiosk is an example of these emerging TTIS technologies. This paper examines the implementation of interactive touch-screen information kiosks, known as "On the Go!" Touch-Screen Travel Stations, at Metropolitan Transportation Authority-New York City Transit (MTA-NYCT) facilities in 2011. It analyzes data from passenger intercept surveys, from the kiosks' built-in application usage logs and from field observations to understand actual passenger utilization of the kiosks and to assess the implications for transit agencies. The field observations also made it possible to obtain a profile of kiosk users, which sheds light on the concept of the "digital divide." The findings, presented as lessons learned, can help agencies elsewhere develop guidelines and effective strategies for implementing similar interactive transit information systems.

AB This paper describes the process of developing a GIS-based traffic accident information system. A roadway network in Kent County, Delaware, was selected to demonstrate the graphic database. The development of the graphic and attribute databases on a workstation environment is described. Software was developed to graphically represent accident information pertaining to any point on the roadway network, and outputs for typical case scenarios are presented. The software also has the capability of displaying historical accident information pertaining to the site. This aspect would be helpful to the planner or designer in studying the impact of a particular roadway design with respect to safety. Some thoughts for future extensions of this study are also presented. Finally, it is concluded that a carefully designed GIS system can efficiently help transportation professionals with traffic safety studies and that its capabilities can be extended to include other areas such as pavement and inventory management, transit applications, and executive information systems.

AB Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS) are generally expected to be efficient in reducing travel time and parking search time uncertainties. This article presents a mixed-behaviour multi-class equilibrium model for investigating heterogeneous drivers' responses to route guidance and parking information systems in stochastic and time-dependent networks. The proposed model simultaneously considers the drivers' choices of departure time, route and parking location under network uncertainty. All drivers are differentiated by their values of time and values of reliability, and each class of them is further divided into two groups, equipped and unequipped with ATIS, respectively. Suppose that the equipped drivers can predict travel disutility more accurately than the unequipped ones due to the information services provided by ATIS. The model is formulated as a fixed-point problem and is solved by a heuristic solution algorithm via a combination of the Monte Carlo simulation approach and the method of successive averages. The effectiveness of the modelling framework is illustrated by a numerical example and some new insights about the complex travel and parking behaviour under ATIS are obtained.

AB This paper models the growth rate and the saturation market penetration level for advanced traveler information system (ATIS) products/services with heterogeneous drivers, The price of using and the benefit gained from ATIS services are considered two key factors in explaining the growth of adoption of ATIS products. The information benefit is measured as the travel time saving between equipped and unequipped drivers and evaluated by a mixed stochastic and deterministic network equilibrium model. A modified logistic type growth model is adopted to describe the cumulative adoption of ATIS products over years. The final stationary equilibrium level of ATIS market penetration is so determined that the value of the information provided will decline to the point at which no new users will find it advantageous to purchase that service. The endogenous growth and stationary equilibrium model of market penetration of ATIS services is useful for forecasting the growth process and the impacts on the system performance of ATIS.

AB The applicability and reliability of accident analysis and prediction models depend on their ability to integrate relevant input from disparate databases in a seamless and automated manner. These inputs include information on road geometry, traffic composition, accident profiles, and spatial referencing. With powerful functionality in spatial referencing, data management, and visualization, geographic information systems (GISs) provide a natural platform for this type of model. An integrated and user-friendly GIS platform for road accident analysis and prediction is described. To demonstrate this platform, it has been applied to safety problems specified at different levels of spatial aggregation, from individual route sections to the overall network. The model was developed by using databases obtained from the Ontario Ministry of Transportation.

AB This study is a subsequent development of the dynamic evolution model of the market penetration of advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) proposed by Yang and Meng [Transport. Res. A 35 (2001) 895]. In previous study we have shown that a benefit-driven, user-optimal ATIS market does not necessarily lead to a socially optimal growth and optimal stationary equilibrium level of market penetration of ATIS products or services. The current study proposes an optimal time-dependent service pricing strategy so as to minimize total system cost throughout the time horizon of growth or optimally reach a socially desirable target level of ATIS market penetration in a final stationary equilibrium. We formulate the problem of interest as an optimal control problem and propose an efficient solution algorithm together with a numerical demonstration of the characteristics of the study problem.

AB The continuous growth of road traffic increases the delays that road users face and negatively affects the overall transportation system performance. Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) may offer significant benefits in terms of improving the travel experience of individuals, but their impact on individuals' travel behavior and on the whole transportation system mainly depends on how travelers respond to the acquired traffic information. This article presents a case study on travelers' response to traffic information for the Puget Sound Region (PSRC). The data used come from travel diaries ( collected in 2000), in which individuals were asked about the traveler information sources consulted on each trip and how the information was used. Traveler information sources, available in the region, encompass both conventional forms of information, such as radio traffic reports and advanced traveler information systems, for example, variable message signs (VMS) and websites. The objective of this study is to examine the impact of information acquisition on switching travel behavior. Two models have been estimated: a multinomial logit model (MNL) and a mixed multinomial logit model (MMNL) that accounts for correlation among observations from the same individuals in the data set. The estimated models show that travel pattern characteristics, the time of information acquisition (pretrip vs. en-route), the source, and the content of provided information significantly affect commuters' response to information.

AB Maritime ports play a crucial role in the development of domestic and international trade and economies. Although near-port communities profit from economic benefits, there exist significant concerns regarding exposure to air emissions, which affect human health and climate change. To tackle this issue, a port authority can develop emission reduction plans and projects, whose performance is tracked through an air emissions inventory (EI). Despite the attention on EI methodologies in the past, little research has focused on the implementation of methodologies in information systems. Therefore, a case study is conducted in this paper to investigate the motivation for creating EIs and the obstacles in the EI-creation process from an information systems perspective. The results indicate that data confidentiality and weak information systems are major obstacles, which hinder the creation of high-quality EIs and generate additional costs. Our findings enable port stakeholders and decision makers to understand the current obstacles and facilitate the development of adequate information systems that support the creation of high-quality EIs.

AB A regional transit feasibility analysis and simulation tool (called RTFAST) can be used to analyze and simulate regional transit system performance. The growth of urban areas coupled with changes in socioeconomic and demographic patterns has resulted in the need to provide for mobility and accessibility in regional and multijurisdictional contexts. In this context, the ability to analyze, simulate, identify, and plan regional transit systems to best serve personal travel patterns is necessary. RTFAST has been developed within a geographic information system-based environment and effectively interfaced with existing travel-demand modeling systems. The capabilities of the tool were demonstrated, and sample results were obtained from its application in Florida.

AB Modern transportation systems, such as computer networks, have become increasingly faster, aiming to "shorten" distances and travel time. This trend allows thinking about new services and induces to reconsider existing ones starting from new technologies, as for Intelligent Transportation Systems. Thereby, an all-encompassing scenario laying at the intersection of several domains, including manufacturing, logistics, traveling, insurance, maintenance, and trading, with the transportation one, can be envisioned. The building block for the resulting transportation ecosystem is an information system that is able to gather and connect all involved stakeholders and domains around the concept of mobility and vehicle to address complex multifaceted problems in an efficient and trustworthy way. This paper proposes the adoption of distributed ledgers to implement such a vehicle-centric information system, distributing data across the network while ensuring trustworthiness. Starting from the vehicle lifecycle immutable and certified information, new services for cross-cuttingly addressing diversity and complexity in the transportation ecosystem can be implemented. The proposed solution merges Multichain and MongoDB technologies to achieve a trade-off between trustworthiness and performance, storing only the metadata in the Multichain network. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by an example on a vehicle trading service showing an overhead for the proposed solution below 18% against a pure MongoDB one on I/O operations.

AB With the advancement of the intelligent transportation system technologies, some automated work zone information systems (AWISs) have been developed and deployed in the field. Their purpose is to provide useful real-time traffic information to motorists as they approach or pass through a work zone. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate AWIS, and most of those studies paid attention to the evaluation of system functionality and reliability. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the effectiveness of the computerized highway information processing system deployed in Southern California, pertaining to the aspects of safety and diversion effects, as well as travelers' acceptance. Evaluation results showed most driver survey respondents liked the system, which was found to be effective in diverting traffic and promoting smoother traffic flow during congested periods.

The hardware framework of the system is built on advanced wireless sensor networks and cloud service over the Internet, and the system is highly scalable. The parking information provided to the users is set in the form of occupancy rates and expected cruising time. Both are obtained from an analytical algorithm that processes historical and real-time data and are then visualized in a color theme. The entire parking system is deployed and extensively evaluated at Stanford University, California, Parking Structure 1.

AB Transportation analysis involving multiple jurisdictions requires data sharing and spatial data interoperability among geographic information system (GIS) data sets. Data sharing and spatial data interoperability issues related to multijurisdictional transportation analysis are discussed. Specific techniques based on practical data-sharing, problem-solving experience are developed. To further enhance the data-sharing process, a conceptual framework is established to guide technique implementations. Regional GIS transportation (GIS-T) platforms integrated from various data sources by applying the framework and the associated techniques are also presented. To better support different transportation applications, an open GIS-T platform is proposed, consisting of a series of customized base maps, each tailored to suit individual applications and, as a whole, linked together by inherently established interoperability.

ID TRANSIT; NETWORKS; DESIGN
AB The integration of wireless and web-based communication technologies in advanced public transport information systems has led to the provision of passenger information services directly to the users. Most of the existing systems provide alternative travel plans either for urban or for single-mode interurban trips. The objective of this paper is to present an online passenger information system for delivering personalized trip-planning services for interurban multimodal trips, including plans for any constituent urban transfer. The proposed system accommodates the provision of critical real-time travel information (e.g., delay or cancelation of flights) to the user throughout the entire life cycle of an interurban trip. The major features of the system are the following: (a) determination of optimum itineraries in a multimodal public transportation network, (b) online updates of the departure times throughout the entire life cycle of the trip, and (c) dissemination of travel information through several communication channels. The proposed system supports two major trip-planning decisions: (a) itinerary planning for an urban trip through the local public transport network, and (b) combined urban and interurban trip planning. The focus of the paper is on the presentation of the design and implementation of the proposed system and its application for supporting trip-planning decisions in Greece. An evaluation of the system has indicated that it is user-friendly, is cost-effective, and meets travelers' requirements.

DE Freeway travel time; loop-detector data; real-time information systems
AB This paper shows that the precision of a freeway travel-time information system, in a real-time context, is not related solely to the accuracy of the measurement. Immediacy in reporting the information and forecasting capabilities play a role. Therefore, focusing only on the accuracy of the travel-time measurement is a myopic approach, which can lead to counter-intuitive results. Specifically, it is claimed that, using travel times estimated with the traditional spot-speed midpoint algorithm, the performance of the real-time information system when evolving traffic conditions prevail is better than using much more accurate directly measured travel times (MTTs). Guidelines for an adequate configuration of the common parameters of the system are provided. In addition, real-time context enhancements for travel-time estimation methods based on punctual speed measurements are proposed. These are addressed by taking into account an easy and practical implementation. They have been proven to work well in an empirical application on a Spanish freeway.

AB A prototype of a location-aware travel guide for pedestrians was designed and implemented with the aid of mobile geographical information systems. Unlike traditional paper maps, the digital travel guide offers a customized user interface and a location-specific travel service. Development was done on a desktop computer, and the essential files subsequently were transferred to a personal digital assistant for field trials. By using the Global Positioning System, the prototype can accurately pinpoint a user's location to a certain tolerance. This detection is performed at specific intervals, and a list of landmarks is furnished to the user through a Visual Basic script-based interactive graphical user interface. The user can obtain comprehensive information on surrounding buildings or sights, in both textual and digital image forms. A novel indexing method built on road segmentation was implemented to increase search efficiency. Experimental results show that this indexing method has made a significant improvement in system response over the exhaustive search method and thereby helps travelers to find the right way and enjoy their trips.

AB Transit riders negatively perceive transfers because of their inconvenience, often referred to as a transfer penalty. Understanding what affects the transfer penalty can have significant implications for a transit authority and also lead to potential improvements in ridership forecasting models. A new method was developed to assess the transfer penalty on the basis of onboard survey data, a partial path choice model, and geographic information system techniques. This approach was applied to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority subway system in downtown Boston. The new method improves the estimates of the transfer penalty, reduces the complexity of data processing, and improves the overall understanding of the perception of transfers.

ID ON-STREET PARKING; PREDICTION; MANAGEMENT; OCCUPANCY; NETWORKS
AB Mobility-related information systems, such as on-street parking information (OSPI) systems have become more popular in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) industry over the last decade. However, there is a lack of methods to assess their quality at a large scale. This paper introduces a data-driven methodology to measure the true quality by fleet data prioritization-based subsampling strategies (PSSs). It is applied to the use case of OSPI using parking events (PE), but is applicable to other mobility-related information systems utilizing their respective fleet data. PSSs are defined based on neighbourhoods and time periods. Each PSS generates a unique set of spatio-temporally important areas at different quadkey zoom levels over 168 week-hours, called slices. The importance weight in each slice depends on the volume of PE within them. The algorithm for each PSS automatically selects important areas and time frames that are vital to be observed. Sample prediction models are used for the benefits assessment of the methodology by comparing it against non-prioritized randomized selection of ground truth. It is proven that the methodology can lessen the effort of ground truth collection, while maintaining the amount of information necessary to assess the true quality of a prediction model.

AB Many metropolitan cities experience severe congestion on their expressways. Advanced traveler information systems (ATISs) have been proposed as possible solutions for reducing congestion. A novel type of ATIS is presented; it is designed for network control of expressways and consists of three new kinds of variable message signs (VMSs). These VMSs are network-level guidance signs, road section signs, and entrance condition signs. Network-level guidance signs and road section signs provide traffic information in a graphical form, and entrance condition signs provide information about on-ramp conditions in a textual style. The ATIS composition and the functions of different VMSs are first presented. Then the information provision method for VMSs is addressed, followed by site placement of VMSs. ATIS evaluation results are presented and, finally, recommendations for future research are described.

AB In this paper we argue that visualization, data management and computational capabilities of geographic information systems (GIS) can assist transportation stated preference research in capturing the contextual complexity of many transportation decision environments by providing respondents with maps and other spatial and non-spatial information in graphical form that enhance respondents' understanding of decision scenarios. We explore the multiple inherent contributions of GIS to transportation stated preference data collection and propose, a framework for a GIS-based stated preference survey instrument. We also present the design concepts of two survey prototypes and their GIS implementation for a sample travel mode choice problem.

AB This paper presents the results of a large sample survey designed to investigate the response of commuters to the delivery of traffic information.  The main purpose of the survey was to investigate the impact of traffic information on commuters route choices, mode choices, and departure times in order to provide functional requirements for the design of a real-time motorist information system.  The surveyed population consisted of 3,893 freeway motorists who routinely commuted to a central business district.  The results of the survey indicated that four distinct commuter subgroups existed with respect to their traffic information needs.  These groups were:  (1) route changers, those willing to change routes on or before entering the freeway (20.6%), (2) nonchangers, those unwilling to change time, route, or mode (23.4%), (3) time and route changers, (40.1%), and (4) pretrip changers, those willing to change time, mode, or route before leaving the house (15.9%).  In terms of receiving traffic information, commercial radio was rated as the most useful and preferred medium both before and while driving.  However, only a small, discrete group of commuters were likely to be influenced to change transportation mode.  Implications of the survey results for the design of a real-time motorist information system are discussed.

ID MONOTONE VARIATIONAL-INEQUALITIES; CONGESTION; MODELS
AB As part of Advanced Transportation Information Systems (ATIS), route planning and guidance (RPG) services have been proposed for potential travel time savings and congestion reduction effects. This study extends previous studies by investigating their effect on consumer surplus and analyzing the tradeoff between network capacity expansions versus RPG services subsidy. Eventually, we analyze whether and to what extent can RPG services substitute network expansion. To answer these questions, this paper develops a mixed-equilibrium model for elastic travel demand and elastic market penetration of RPG services. Drivers are assumed to follow the stochastic user equilibrium conditions, with the drivers equipped with RPG services having lower travel time perception variations. This model is formulated as a nonlinear complementarity problem for exposition clarity and is solved as a variational inequality problem for efficiency. A numerical study is provided to demonstrate the approach.

AB Dynamic network models are needed to analyze traffic congestion patterns for new real-time motorist information systems.  In previous research, a dynamic network modeling framework incorporating behavioral models of drivers' route and departure time choices and their day-to-day adjustment processes was developed.  Network performance in this framework is represented by time dependent arrival and departure rates, link occupancies, and queuing delays.  The purpose of this paper is to extend this framework to include explicit models of drivers' information acquisition and integration.  The need for these models is motivated by considering the possible beneficial and counter-productive effects that may be caused by enhanced motorist information.  Information on network conditions influences the set of routes considered by a driver and also affects the perceived values of the level of service attributes.  The paper presents the structure of a dynamic model in which newly acquired information may affect pretrip and en-route travel decisions.  To assess the potential magnitudes of the effects that were identified further theoretical and empirical research is needed.

AB This paper presents the design and evaluation of an online passenger information system for delivering personalized multimodal trip planning services through the integration of wireless and web-based communication technologies. The goal of the system is to provide real-time travel information throughout the entire life cycle of an interurban trip. Before the full-scale deployment of this type of system, it is essential to assess its impact on the involved stakeholders through a pilot application. The proposed system (ENOSIS) has been implemented and evaluated for supporting travel decisions in Greece. An evaluation framework for assessing the impacts of the ENOSIS system is proposed, and the evaluation results of the ENOSIS pilot application are also reported. The evaluation results provide significant evidence of the technical and operational efficiency of the ENOSIS services, while it is shown that the proposed system is cost effective.

DT Article
AB Fostering sustainable mobility is regarded as a major goal for the future development of cities. The advanced traveller information systems (ATISs), such as multi-modal route planners are envisioned as tools for enhancing more environment-friendly mobility behaviour. The authors' recent study that comprises methods of action research and Delphi forecasting, not only evaluates the actual effectiveness, but also the future expectations with regards to ATIS. Therefore the trans-disciplinary research project 'ITSworks' examined users' and experts' perspectives by working within the example of a multi-modal route planner called 'AnachB' set-up for the city area of Vienna (Austria). Within a 'Test-setting' 38 users tested the systems for several weeks, whereas 31 international experts discussed the potential of ATISs for promoting sustainable mobility in general.

AB SITCUO (Sistemas de lnformacoes de Transportes Coletivos Urbanos por Onibus)-a dynamic information system for urban bus passengers in Brasilia, using business intelligence, was developed to optimize bus operations and increase the satisfaction of urban transportation users. In order to achieve these objectives the system involves the convergence of a number of different technologies, including: Global Positioning System (GPS), Geographic Information System (GIS), database, data mining, Internet and telecommunications. The system includes communication between the GPS, the database, the Control Centre and the user interfaces, which provide estimated bus arrival times via the information display panels and the Internet. The information system at the Control Centre was implemented by applying Java, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) using an object-oriented approach. The paper will present the general description of the system, the algorithms for estimating the arrival time of the bus at the bus stop, the implementation procedure adopted, the results of experiments undertaken on a bus route in Brasilia and the conclusions.

AB This paper describes the spatial information system infrastructure implemented by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) to enable delivery of information to management decision makers in asset management applications. This spatial data warehouse infrastructure makes extensive use of geographic information system (GIS) technologies to integrate information from a variety of database structures and formats. GIS products and tools have been developed to portray and analyze these data in useful combinations focused on practitioner needs. In June 1999 the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued Statement 34 requiring governments to have a systematic approach to managing their assets. As a result, transportation agencies have placed an increased emphasis on developing mechanisms to integrate information from disparate management information systems and legacy databases. IDOT has used G IS to develop a spatial data warehouse to enable integration. A valuable characteristic of the department's information systems infrastructure is the embedding of the underlying link-node structure into roadway inventory databases to enable the direct linkage of data through various system identifiers, including differing milepost referencing and project numbering schemes. This direct linkage enables the complex integration of asset management-related data files across the enterprise and provides access to historical asset information. Changes to route referencing systems are readily accommodated, without loss of integrative capabilities. Outputs include a variety of user-developed analyses and output products with accessibility through networks, intranets, and the Internet.

AB Determination of a runway orientation is a critical task in the planning and design of an airport. The direction of the runway controls the layout of the other airport facilities, such as passenger terminals, taxiways/apron configurations, circulation roads, and parking facilities. This paper presents a geographic information systems (GIS)-based system called airport runway optimization (ARO) that determines the best runway orientation for the effective layout of air-port facilities. The paper first provides an overview of the previous research efforts with regards to runway orientation and investigates Federal Aviation Administration standards, wind conditions, airspace obstructions, topographic settings, and other factors that apply to runway design. It then addresses a GIS-based wind rose method that automates the determination of runway placement. The ARO system uses the GIS-based wind rose method and customized GIS functions and database management tools to successfully solve the "partial coverage" problem. The ARO system significantly improves the current efforts of using "trial and error" and computation-intensive methods to determine runway alignment.

TI Evaluation of information applications of a self-organizing distributed
   traffic information system for a large-scale real-world traffic network
SO COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB This article presents an evaluation of the system performance of a proposed self-organizing, distributed traffic information system based on vehicle-to-vehicle information-sharing architecture. Using microsimulation, several information applications derived from this system are analyzed relative to the effectiveness and efficiency of the system to estimate traffic conditions along each individual path in the network, to identify possible incidents in the traffic network, and to provide rerouting strategies for vehicles to escape congested spots in the network. A subset of vehicles in the traffic network is equipped with specific intervehicle communication devices capable of autonomous traffic surveillance, peer-to-peer information sharing, and self-data processing. A self-organizing traffic information overlay on the existing vehicular roadway network assists their independent evaluation of route information, detection of traffic incidents, and dynamic rerouting in the network based both on historical information stored in an in-vehicle database and on real-time information disseminated through intervehicle communications. A path-based microsimulation model is developed for these information applications and the proposed distributed traffic information system is tested in a large-scale real-world network. Based on simulation study results, potential benefits both for travelers with such equipment as well as for the traffic system as a whole are demonstrated.

TI Intervehicle Safety Warning Information System for Unsafe Driving Events
   Methodology and Prototypical Implementation
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Driver inattentiveness and distraction resulting in unsafe vehicle maneuvers are a significant safety concern because such behavior can directly lead to crashes. An effective technical countermeasure is to detect unsafe driving events and provide drivers with advanced warning information. This study presents an intervehicle safety warning information system. An inertial measurement unit consisting of an accelerometer and gyro sensor in addition to a Global Positioning System receiver was used to collect data for the developed algorithm. Vehicle position, speed, acceleration, and angular velocity data were analyzed and were used as inputs for the algorithm. A support vector machine classifier was also incorporated into the algorithm to identify further the severity of unsafe driving events. The performance evaluation results showed that the detection algorithm could capture longitudinal and transverse unsafe driving events. In addition, a prototype of the proposed warning information system was implemented on a test bed in support of vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Extensive field tests have been conducted in the test bed to fine-tune the prototypical system. These results demonstrate that the system holds promise for improving drivers' safety and mitigating crash risks.

AB Inter-Organizational Information Systems (IOISs) for seaport logistics facilitate monitoring operations, the exchange of information with stakeholders, and meeting regulations of foreign trade. However, seaport contexts entail complexities in terms of stakeholder involvement and business processes that must be considered thoroughly toward the successful adoption of IOISs. This research seeks to identify factors influencing the successful adoption of IOISs in seaports. It follows a grounded theory approach relying on semi-structured interviews and expert opinions to identify facilitating conditions for the adoption of IOISs. Survey research was conducted in order to investigate the appraisal of different ports in Latin America and the Caribbean region regarding the diverse conditions. The results obtained were analyzed descriptively and through a Principal Components Analysis. The latter was conducted in order to discern relevant dimensions influencing the adoption of IOISs in seaports. The results of the study allow deriving managerial insights and practical recommendations to support technological plans at ports and guide the decision-making regarding the digitalization process.

AB A method that integrates geographic information systems (GIS) with genetic algorithms (GAs) for optimizing horizontal highway alignments between two given end points is presented in this article. The proposed approach can be used to optimize alignments in highly irregular geographic spaces. The resulting alignments are smooth and satisfy, minimum-radius constraints, as required by highway design standards. The objective function in the proposed model considers land-acquisition cost, environmental impacts such as wetlands and flood plains, length-dependent costs (which are proportional to the alignment length), and user costs. A numerical example based on a real map is employed to demonstrate application of the proposed model to the preliminary design of horizontal alignments.

AB Traveler information has the potential to reduce travel times and improve their reliability. Studies have verified that driver overreaction from the dissemination of information can be eliminated through prediction-based route guidance that uses short-term forecasts of network state. Critical off-line tests of advanced dynamic traffic assignment-based prediction systems have been limited, since the system being evaluated has also been used as the test bed. This paper outlines a detailed simulation-based laboratory for the objective and independent evaluation of advanced traveler information systems, a laboratory with the flexibility to analyze the impacts of various design parameters and modeling errors on the quality of the generated guidance. MITSIMLab, a system for the evaluation of advanced traffic management systems, is integrated with Dynamic Network Assignment for the Management of Information to Travelers (DynaMIT), a simulation-based decision support system designed to generate prediction-based route guidance. Evaluation criteria and requirements for the closed-loop integration of MITSIMLab and DynaMIT are discussed. Detailed case studies demonstrating the evaluation methodology and sensitivity of DynaMIT's guidance are presented.

AB In recent years, increasing attention has been drawn to the development of various applications of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which are credited with the amelioration of traffic conditions in urban and regional environments. Advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) constitute an important element of ITS by providing potential travelers with information on the network's current performance both en-route and pre-trip. In order to tackle the complexity of such systems, derived from the difficulty of providing real-time estimations of current as well as forecasts of future traffic conditions, a series of models and algorithms have been initiated. This paper proposes the development of an integrated framework for real-time ATIS and presents its application on a large-scale network, that of Thessaloniki, Greece, concluding with a discussion on development and implementation challenges as well as on the advantages and limitations of such an effort.

AB Travellers can benefit from the availability of point-to-point driving time estimates on a real time basis for making travel decisions such as route choice at strategic locations (e.g. junctions of major routes). This paper reports a predictive travel time methodology that features a Bayesian approach to fusing and updating information for use in advanced traveller information system. The methodology addresses the issue that data captured in real time on travel conditions becomes obsolete and has archival value only unless it is used as an input to a predictive travel time method for updating the information. The need for fusing real time data with other factors that influence travel time is defined and the concept of predictive travel time is discussed. The methodological framework and its components are advanced and an example application is provided for illustrating the fusion of data captured by infrastructure-based and mobile technology with model-based predictions in order to produce expected travel times.

AB The quality of Vessel Traffic Management and Information Systems depends on the quality of all subsystems, in particular the quality of control centres. The most commonly used quantitative indicators of the control centres' quality are: reliability, availability, safety, and system failure. Therefore, a block diagram of reliability and the model for reliability / availability (Markov model) have been created in this paper and a detailed analysis and calculation of the quantitative indicators of critical components (servers) of the control centre have been performed. The quality functioning of the control centres will enable gathering, processing, storing and dissemination of timely, safe, and reliable data and information to the services in charge of monitoring and management of maritime traffic.

AB Predicting benefits of advanced traveler information systems before implementation is one of the challenges in the area of transport modeling. Taking into consideration the differences in commuting behavior of unequipped and would be equipped drivers, as well as their different level of perception error are the key factor. Accordingly, it seems that the multi-class approach of traffic assignment (TA) can be regarded as a possible solution to the problem. However, dealing with the challenge of lack of observed data before system installation is still a major challenge.
   To deal with this problem, a double-class stochastic TA approach is proposed in this work. The network loading procedure follows a paired combinatorial logit (PCL) model, which addresses the classical problem of path overlapping. In addition, the model is origin-destination (OD)-specific parameter, which enables the modeler to represent different levels of uncertainty and stochasticity involved in route decision-making between different OD pairs. A heuristic practical estimation method is also proposed, which exempts the modeler from resorting to route choice data and facilitates the challenges involved in estimation of route choice models to a considerable extent. Furthermore, in the approximate proposed method of estimation, the new perspective from which the estimation parameter is considered provides a more tangible interpretation than that of the classical approach. It allows manipulation of data to obtain some sort of synthesized information as to the route choice behavior of prospective equipped travelers. The estimation method is applied to an experimental data set and the TA method is tested on an illustrative network. Authors demonstrate that, given the market penetration of the system, how the analyst would be able to provide quantitative forecasts as to the expected improvements in the network performance as a result of being introduced to advanced travelers information systems.

AB The South Jersey Real-Time Motorist Information System project is aimed at the rapid deployment of available intelligent transportation system surveillance and communication technologies to monitor traffic on the basis of need at various locations in the South Jersey highway network. The proposed system is a highly mobile traffic-surveillance design that includes mobile, self-sufficient, sensor units with communications and data-collection capabilities that allow the sensor unit to exchange information with the traffic-control center. The sensor units can be installed easily at any location on the transportation network without delays for establishing power and communication connections. This rapid-deployment capability meets the goal for easy-to-deploy traffic-surveillance units that can be used to manage the transportation system during any type of disaster. A technical overview and the advantages of this system and its evaluation procedure are presented. In addition, the problems faced and lessons learned during the implementation, along with future plans for deployment, are presented.

AB Models and algorithms for vehicle routing are usually based on known constant travel times between all relevant locations, an assumption that is far from reality particularly for urban areas. But the consideration of travel times that vary with the time of day poses two serious problems: the adaptation of the algorithms and the procurement of reliable data about the behavior of the travel times in the road network. This article describes the derivation of travel time data from modern traffic information systems. It presents a general framework for the implementation of time-varying travel times in various vehicle-routing algorithms. Finally, it reports on computational tests with travel time data obtained from a traffic information system in the city of Berlin.

ID MONITORING NETWORK
AB Evaluation of travel-time data quality from traveler information systems (TISs) is a critical need for many transportation agencies. To measure data quality, observations of ground-truth travel time must be collected on links in a transportation network. Therefore, selecting which links in the network to monitor is a critical step in evaluating the quality of a TIS. This paper presents a maximum entropy sampling (MES) design that can be used to objectively select a subset of links from a road network for ground-truth data collection. This approach objectively identifies subsets of links that have the greatest variability in traffic conditions. This allows for a more rigorous evaluation of a TIS to determine the system's ability to effectively capture changing traffic conditions. The MES method was evaluated using both a simulated and an empirical data set.

AB We consider a specific advanced traveler information system (ATIS) whose objective is to reduce drivers' time uncertainty with recurrent network congestion through provision of traffic information to drivers. Suppose drivers equipped with an ATIS will receive complete information and hence be able to find the minimum travel time routes in a user-optimal manner, while drivers not equipped with an ATIS will have only incomplete information and hence may take longer travel time routes in a stochastic manner. We propose a convex programming model and an algorithm to solve this mixed behavior equilibrium problem for any given level of the market penetration of ATIS. Furthermore, suppose that the information benefit received by a driver who buys an ATIS is measured as the travel time saving (stochastic mean travel time minus deterministic minimum travel time in a mixed behavior equilibrium over a common network), and the market penetration of ATIS is determined by a continuous increasing function of the information benefit, then we have a variable, mixed behavior equilibrium model with endogenous market penetration in an ATIS environment. We establish the existence, uniqueness and stability of this performance and demand equilibrium of ATIS, and propose an iterative procedure to calculate the ATIS market penetration and the resulting equilibrium network flow pattern.

ID NETWORK; MODEL
AB In many major metropolitan areas, taxi services have played an important role as a semipublic transportation mode without public support. However, there has not been much modeling effort-despite the importance of taxis in urban transportation systems-mainly because of the difficulty in modeling taxi drivers' behavior. This study models a taxi service system in urban areas, taking into account taxi drivers' knowledge of the transportation network built from their day-to-day experience. Passenger-seeking behavior by taxi drivers is modeled on the basis of their expected travel time and expected waiting time. The model considers the stochastic and dynamic transportation network and various levels of network knowledge on the part of drivers. This modeling approach provides flexibility in modeling the characteristics of taxi operation as well as understanding how taxi drivers' capability evolves. The study analyzes the fleet size of taxi service systems and the effects of the taxi company's information systems by considering quality and operational efficiency of taxi services, from both the passengers' and taxi operators' points of view. A simulation experiment shows that the taxi information system can provide benefits equivalent to increasing the number of taxis by 20% in regard to the quality of taxi service.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB In this paper a new robust optimization (110) model is proposed for route guidance based on the advanced traveler information system. The are travel time is treated as a random variable, and its distribution is estimated from historical data. Traditional stochastic routing models just minimize the expected travel time between the origin and the destination. Such approaches do not account for the fact that travelers often incorporate travel time variability in their decision making. Recently some RO models were proposed to incorporate more statistical information into the models, but these models still ignore much information available from historical travel time data. The probability measurement, time at risk (TaR), is introduced in this paper, and a multiobjective model is built up that allows a trade-off between the expected travel time and the TaR. Thus, the skewness and kurtosis of the arc travel time distribution are taken into consideration; that is important because the travel time distributions of typical arcs show high asymmetry and long tails on the right side as a result of the impact of random incidents and events. This approach is applied in two examples, one of which is a real traffic network.

AB This article analyzes the role of advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) in conjunction with signal setting (SS) design. ATIS and SS are considered as planning options for network optimization under recurrent traffic conditions. The traffic network is considered in within-day static, as is usual for planning-oriented models. Both day-to-day static (equilibrium) and dynamic states are investigated. Notably, equilibrium and stability can influence the feasibility of SS solutions. In addition, the role of ATIS is assessed with regard to its suitability in equilibrating SS optima and/or stabilizing SS equilibria. Travelers' compliance with information, which plays a crucial role in both optimization and stabilization, is explicitly modeled. A formal modeling framework is introduced, allowing SS and ATIS to be represented, and several benefits and drawbacks of SS and ATIS options are explored. The model is then used for simulations on a hypothetical network. The results suggest the potential of the modeling framework and lead to nontrivial findings about the role of ATIS.

AB The use of high-technology systems in the transport sector has increased steadily over recent years. This paper outlines the development of vehicle monitoring and control systems and their use in the public transport arena. The paper shows how one such system, that operated by Datatrak Ltd., has been adapted to provide a real time passenger information system for the RiverBus Partnership in London.(2) Passenger use and perception of the system is evaluated, based on surveys of RiverBus users. This provides an evaluation of the system, and highlights the importance of introducing such systems based on user information needs and as part of the total marketing package.

AB Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATISs) include a broad range of advanced computer and communication technologies. These systems are designed to provide transit riders pre-trip and real-time information, to make better informed decisions regarding their mode of travel, planned routes and travel times. ATISs include in-vehicle displays, terminal or wayside based information centres, information by phone or mobile and internet. In this article, a Stated Preference survey has been carried out in order to know the preferences of public transport's customers related to different ATISs and their willingness to pay in Palermo. An ordered probit demand model has been calibrated to determine the potential additional share of demand attracted by the adoption of ATISs. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation has been carried out to appraise the uncertainty on some parameters of the calibrated demand model. The results show that respondents give more importance to the type of information and its cost, whereas they are less interested in the system that provides the information.

AB For many geographic information system applications, such as pavement management and traffic inventories, sections of highway routes may be broken into predefined segments of fixed or variable lengths. The use of fixed-length segments or variable-length segments can present problems in data redundancy or require cumbersome spatial edits when attributes change. Dynamic segmentation was developed to address these problems. Used in conjunction with a milepoint linear-referencing scheme, dynamic segmentation can provide an efficient means for storing varying highway data. However, when dealing with very small segments and constantly changing attributes, the number of segments can make the use of dynamic segmentation slow and cumbersome. Introduced is a multi-criteria dynamic segmentation approach that allows on-the-fly segment-length specification before a linear referenced table is attached to a route. Once the segment length is specified, the attribute data are binned by using database manipulation and aggregation operations based on a user-defined set of criteria. By using binned data, dynamic segmentation speed is enhanced considerably. Small-scale thematic maps of binned data are much more readable, and data spikes can be removed in the binning process. The underlying reference database containing the original small segment attribute data is never compromised in the binning process. The approach was developed specifically to accommodate managing pavement retroreflectivity data in a geographic information system. The system architecture is described, and other types of spatial data that may benefit from this approach are identified.

AB Current barriers to maintaining economies of scale for delivery include far distances of the depots from customers, road usage restrictions, customers' delivery requests, and social, environmental, and economic costs. In many developed and developing countries, the effects of urbanization have increased city population. Such migration to cities is also attracting more movement of commodities into the city center. This research aimed to study the effectiveness and viability of urban distribution centers from a tactical viewpoint of planning for city logistics. A multiagent modeling approach with geographical information system support was used to test an urban distribution center (UDC) in Osaka City, Japan. The key findings from this research concluded that the UDC has potential for emissions reduction, but sustainability of the UDC is reliant on the UDC charges and carriers' sensitivity to the rate of charges.

AB Research on the acceptability of assistive systems for improving the safety of powered two-wheelers (PTWs) is a pressing issue. The use of safety-enhancing assistive systems for motorised vehicles, including advanced driver assistance systems and in-vehicle information systems is widespread in many countries. Yet, there is only a limited number of equivalent intelligent transport systems (ITS) for PTWs, namely advanced rider assistance systems and on-bike information systems. This study describes the methodological development of a specific tool for assessing motorcyclists' acceptability of ITS, as part of the motorcyclists' profiling questionnaire (MOPROQ). There were three stages of development. First, a literature review was undertaken to assess the current state of the art regarding ITS for PTWs and to determine the most relevant facets of acceptability that should be measured. Second, a series of focus group interviews were conducted to explore riders' attitudes towards ITS. Finally, the focus group results were used to develop a large-scale survey (MOPROQ), which was administered to an initial sample of over 6000 riders internationally. The designed tool can be used as a basis for the determination of rider acceptability of ITS systems in the future.

AB The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in road safety analysis has increased rapidly in recent years. They have proved to be effective in answering simple accident enquiries and identifying single sites with a high number of accidents; however, this nowhere near represents their full potential. This paper describes a number of additional applications that make use of a GIS and include methods to better identify mistakes in the police accident report forms, improve the selection of routes and areas suitable for remedial treatment, provide additional information on the safety of school based journeys and identify the home location of road accident casualties. These improvements in the quantity and quality of information should lead to a more accurate and efficient selection of engineering measures and road safety campaigns.

AB In times of accelerating urbanization and environmental pollution, mode choice decisions (MCD) are a critical parameter in a city's appearance and its environmental impacts. Simultaneously, the emerging smartphone multimodal traveller information systems (SMTIS) simplifies the usage of multimodal trips and, therefore, enhance the options in MCD. Current MCD models, in addition to considering classic parameters like travel time and cost, also consider socioeconomic variables and latent variables, such as modal preferences or mode-specific characteristics. However, from the users' perspective, one main influence is currently still not sufficiently considered in these models: Coordination costs for planning the trip, such as looking-up time tables for public transport. Consequently, we introduced this variable in a multinomial logit model and made a representative survey in Germany for measuring the coordination effort and evaluating our model. Our results support our hypothesis that coordination costs have a significant impact on MCD. We therefore conclude that further developments in information systems together with supporting policies may influence the MCD and, hence, lead to more sustainable cities in the future.

TI Understanding the influence of state of health on the range anxiety of

ID LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; DRIVING EXPERIENCE; STRESS; USAGE
AB Owing to the limited range, battery electric vehicle drivers are likely to worry about being stranded in range-critical situations, known as range anxiety. Research has revealed that the provision of accurate information through range-related in-vehicle information systems establishes a solution to overcome range anxiety. However, an important range-related information i.e. the battery state of health, is seldom being considered in the research of range anxiety due to the difficulty in daily-use acquisition. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the influence of state of health on the range anxiety of battery electric vehicle drivers by performing a driving experiment. Under the condition of state of health degradation, participants used simplified battery electric vehicle simulators equipped with different types of in-vehicle information systems to finish a designated trip in a range-critical situation. During and after the trip, they measured their experienced range anxiety level. Results show that participants perceive less range anxiety when the in-vehicle information system provides the remaining range corrected by the state of health, and range anxiety can be further reduced when the extra correlated information (the state of health) is displayed on the in-vehicle information systems. The findings provide useful inspirations that range anxiety can be reduced if the range-related in-vehicle information system is well designed in information content and presentation considering the state of health.

AB Many large cities in Korea have either implemented or are planning to install a bus information system (BIS) in order to improve the quality of service for bus passengers. This is mainly being conducted by providing bus arrival times at bus stops. In these systems, similar systematic errors occur in the estimation of bus arrival times, which are influenced by the information updating time (cycle length) taken to identify each bus location, the information processing time, and the cycle length required to update the bus arrival information on each terminal. The systematic errors can occur in the collection of data, information processing, and in the passenger waiting time. This study investigated these systematic errors and developed a statistical method for correcting these errors in order to improve the accuracy of the BIS information. The proposed method is based on probability density functions and the random incidence concept. The developed method was then applied to the BIS of a city in Korea in order to verify the efficacy of the method. Through the verification results, there was a 23% error reduction after applying the error correction method to the BIS. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Managing low-volume roads with Wisconsin information system for local
   roads
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Managers of low-volume roads face numerous challenges, including budgeting, maintenance decision making, and developing best practices. States such as Wisconsin have recently taken a proactive approach in assisting local officials in their roadway asset management activities. Aspects of the Wisconsin Information System for Local Roads (WISLR) that benefit local road managers by enhancing their asset management capabilities are discussed. Also offered are suggestions for future work to enhance roadway management tools for low-volume roads. WISLR originated with a Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) effort to create a web-based geographic information system (GIS) that would provide both the state agency and the 1,922 local units of government with accurate tracking of roadway mileage and pavement conditions for the more than 100,000 mi of roads and streets under local government control. The sizes of local road systems vary widely by municipality, from less than 9 mi to more than 600 mi of roadway. Many of these roads fall into the low-volume category, particularly in the smaller jurisdictions. WisDOT hoped to provide municipalities with a powerful tool to track roadway mileage and conditions, as well as to aid in system management decisions. WISLR offers a unique opportunity for local governments to capitalize on the powerful tools made available by this application. WISLR combines GIS technology with database application tools based on the Pavement Surface Evaluation Rating system, allowing municipalities to perform long-range planning.

AB We present an advanced traveler information system (ATIS) for public and private transportation, including vehicle sharing and pooling services. The ATIS uses an agent-based architecture and multi-objective optimization to answer trip planning requests from multiple users in a co-modal setting, considering vehicle preferences and conflicting criteria. At each set of users' requests, the transportation network is represented by a co-modal graph that allows decomposing the trip planning problem into smaller tasks: the shortest routes between the network nodes are determined and then combined to obtain possible itineraries. Using multi-objective optimization, the set of user-vehicle-route combinations according to the users' preferences is determined, ranking all possible route agents' coalitions. The ATIS is tested for the real case study of the Lille metropolitan area (Nord Pas de Calais, France).

AB A comprehensive benefit-cost analysis was performed using the results of model deployments of the Commercial Vehicle Information Systems and Networks (CVISN) program, which provides electronic credentialing and electronic screening of heavy trucks to improve their safe and efficient to operation. CVISN is intended to enable a regulatory system to operate at reduced cost and increased effectiveness for both its users and society. Benefit-cost analysis is a public-sector evaluation tool that compares all of a project's benefits to society with all of the project's costs to society. The question to be answered in undertaking such an analysis is: do these benefits exceed the costs? In the case of the CVISN programs evaluated, considerable public benefits can be expected, and the benefits greatly exceed the costs. From the results of several representative CVISN deployment scenarios examined, it appears prudent to proceed with full deployment of such systems.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB This paper describes journey-planning procedures designed for use in a traveller information system covering fixed-schedule and demand-responsive public transport modes. The task is to construct a sequence of journey-legs to meet a traveller's requirements with the least possible generalised cost, subject to time-window and other constraints. A journey may be carried out in a single leg by walking or by taking a taxi all the way from the origin to the destination, or by a sequence of one or more legs carried by public transport services sandwiched between walked segments connecting an initial pickup and final setdown stop. The public transport services may include fixed-route modes such as bus and train, and demand-responsive services running between fixed points. The main planning procedures are a high-level request-broker and a branch and bound procedure to handle multi-legged journeys; the request-broker also invokes a fleet-scheduling module to obtain bookings on demand-responsive services. The paper describes planning conditions, the planning procedures, and reduction techniques that are used to obtain acceptable computational performance. Tests with simulated demand suggest that the procedures are well suited for use in a real-time traveller information system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE calibration; traffic assignment; simulation; models
AB This paper is an attempt to address the issue of data flow interdependency and error propagation in Advanced Traveler Information Systems/Advanced Traffic Management Systems supporting simulation-based models. A complex dynamic simulation model constitutes a number of processes, variables, or parameters with varying impact on the model's state estimation accuracy. The overall model error might be attributed to the propagating internal system errors. This paper presents a framework for calibrating simulation models developed to support the dynamic traffic assignment systems. The calibration framework employs off-line analyses on the model processes, input, and system data, and the results are utilized to identify the model processes causing significant errors and to quantify the propagation of a specific variable error. The framework could be utilized to rank the model processes and their variables so that resources are allocated to calibrating significant error-causing entities. The framework is tested on a microscopic simulation model, MTSSIMA, and the results are discussed.

AB The paper describes a new methodology for performing travel time studies using global positioning system (GPS) and geographic information system (GIS) technologies. It documents the data collection, data reduction, and data reporting procedures, as well as analyses that illustrate the capabilities of the GPS/GIS methodology. The data collection procedure uses GPS receivers to automatically collect time, local coordinates, and speed at regular sampling periods, for example every one second. The data reduction procedure filters and aggregates GPS data to compute travel time and speed along highway segments. The data reporting procedure uses a GIS-based management information system to define queries, tabular reports, and color coded maps to document travel time data along these highway segments. These procedures have been implemented in three metropolitan areas in Louisiana: Baton Rouge, Shreveport, and New Orleans. In these cities, more than 180,000 segment travel time and speed records were derived between 1995 and 1996 from nearly three million GPS data points collected on 30,000 miles of travel time runs along 300 miles of urban highways. The three analyses included in the paper to assist in the process of understanding the GPS/GIS methodology are the following: segment lengths, sampling rates, and central tendency. The segment length analysis examines the effect of using different highway segment lengths and shows that relatively short segments (0.2-0.5 miles long) are needed to detect localized traffic effects. These traffic disturbances become visible only when segment lengths are at most half the length of the associated disturbance. This means that traditional link-based segments, which are typically longer than 0.5 miles, are not sufficient to characterize localized effects properly. The sampling rate analysis addresses the effect of collecting GPS data at different sampling periods and shows that for a segment to have GPS data associated with it, the GPS sampling period should be smaller than half the shortest travel time associated with the segment. The analysis also shows a tradeoff between sampling rates and segment speed reliability, and emphasizes the need for even shorter GPS sampling periods (1-2s) in order to minimize errors in the computation of segment speeds. The central tendency analysis compares harmonic mean speeds and median speeds and shows that median speeds are more robust estimators of central tendency than harmonic mean speeds.

AB Despite persistent claims in the motor carrier industry of poorer safety performance of owner-operators, there is little empirical work directly comparing owner-operator safety performance to that of employee drivers. This study assesses the statistical significance of differences in the safety performance between owner-operators and employee drivers. This study also expands on previous driver focused safety models by examining how driver and carrier characteristics affect safety performance. Data for this study were derived from the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS), and the Commercial Driver's License Information System (CDLIS) databases. Study results provide evidence that owner-operators are associated with more driver- and vehicle-out-of-service violations but experience lower crash rates than do employee drivers.

TI Use of Light Detection and Ranging Data to Identify and Quantify
   Intersection Obstruction and Its Severity
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The identification of obstructions at intersections is crucial for roadway safety improvement. Field measurements used to identify intersection obstructions, however, are labor intensive, costly, and dangerous. This study explores the feasibility of identifying obstructions at intersections by using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data already available for flood analysis. Because it can model three-dimensional objects, emerging LIDAR technology provides a good way to identify intersection obstructions. The objective of this study was to propose a methodology that could identify intersection obstructions by using LiDAR technology, three-dimensional terrain modeling, a plane-of-sight, and geographic information system spatial analysis. The methodology that was sought was also one that could quantify the severity levels of intersection obstructions and, potentially, be used to prioritize improvements for network-level safety. With the use of LiDAR data already available from Savannah, Georgia, experimental tests were conducted to identify obstructions at intersections. The intersection obstructions, identified with the proposed methodology, were compared with those obtained with the use of the 100-ft (30.5-m) line-of-sight (LOS) method. Results showed that the proposed method correctly identified 92% of intersection obstructions, compared with 64% identified by the LOS method. The severity levels of intersection sight distance obstructions also were quantified. Results showed that the proposed methodology provided a feasible platform and method for transportation agencies to use emerging LiDAR technology to identify intersection obstructions.

TI Safety Effects of Horizontal Curve and Grade Combinations on Rural
   Two-Lane Highways
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The safety effects of horizontal curves and grades on highways have been quantified separately, but it is not currently known whether or how the safety performance of horizontal curves interacts with that of grades. Although the first edition of the AASHTO Highway Safely Manual provides crash modification factors for the safety effects of horizontal curvature and percent grade on rural two-lane highways, the manual does not have a method for accounting for the interactions between these effects. In other words, in the Highway Safely Manual procedures for rural two-lane highways, the safety effect of a horizontal curve is the same whether the curve is located on a level roadway, a straight grade, or a vertical curve. Similarly, the safety effect of a straight grade is the same whether it is located on a tangent roadway or horizontal curve. Researchers have always supposed that there are interactions between the safety effects of horizontal and vertical alignments, but these interactions have not been demonstrated in a form useful for safety prediction. The results of research undertaken to quantify the safety effects of five types of horizontal and vertical alignment combinations based on Highway Safety Information System data and crash records from 2003 to 2008 in Washington State are summarized. The outcome is a set of safety prediction models for fatal and injury and property-damage-only crashes. To present the results in a form suitable for incorporation into the Highway Safety Manual, crash modification factors representing safety performance relative to level tangents were developed from these models for each of the five combinations.

TI Optimizing Environmental Sensor Station Locations for Road Weather

ID INFORMATION-SYSTEM; IMPACTS; CRASHES
AB Adverse weather poses a significant threat to transportation safety. Road weather information systems (RWIS) are used to mitigate the impact of adverse weather. Because of the lack of detailed, unified guidelines and because of diverse weather conditions across the United States, state and city transportation agencies follow different practices for choosing locations for environmental sensor stations. This paper proposes a comprehensive cell-based methodology that optimizes overall benefits of RWIS based on weather-sensitive crash characterizations and using both normal and adverse weather crash data. The proposed approach is especially suited to optimizing regionwide environmental sensor station locations involving many road segments. A case study concerning RWIS deployment in Austin, Texas, was conducted with data from a crash records information system for 2010 to 2013.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB A genetic algorithm (GA) was developed to optimize a bus transit system serving an irregularly shaped area with a grid street network. The developed objective total cost function was minimized subject to realistic demand distribution and street pattern. The service area in New York City was selected as an example to demonstrate the application of the developed model. With the application of geographic information systems, the street network within the service area was obtained and applied, while the passenger demand information was approximated based on the New York City census report of 1990. The optimal number of bus routes and their locations were found by applying the proposed GA, while the optimal headways of the routes were analytically derived. The method developed here can be applied to dynamic routing buses under various incident situations.

AB Locating statewide crashes for system or facility analyses can be difficult and time-consuming. In many localities, crash data are manually transcribed from paper crash reports and then located, by a separate operator, on a linear reference scheme. Data quality and quantity reduce an operator's ability to accurately identify route and milepoint locations for a large percentage of crashes. A study of crash data in Georgia has identified potential location errors. The study also revealed that numerous technical solutions such as improved data transcription guidelines, multiple public and private road databases, geographic information systems, and standard relational databases potentially can strengthen the functionality of crash location systems. An analysis of an existing crash location procedure is described, and alternative techniques designed to speed the location process and improve location accuracy are discussed.

AB Although parking is an important issue in transportation engineering and planning, little research has examined the use of new parking information technologies in rural communities. The Clemson University campus, in South Carolina, was used as a case study to determine the ability of roadside parking information systems to reduce delay, cut travel time, and manage changing volumes of cars. To examine these effects, a traffic simulation model of the campus was built, calibrated, and validated. The model used a dynamic assignment approach to capture the rerouting of vehicles in response to parking availability information for several key parking lots. It was found that use of roadside parking information systems, such as dynamic message signs, can reduce delay while not significantly affecting volumes, travel times, or speeds. The findings suggested that delay reduction was caused by a decrease in vehicle circulation time.

AB Actual bus arrival times often deviate from the posted schedules due to a variety of factors; hence, providing real-time bus information can improve service quality. This study examined users' views and perceptions towards the possible future availability of real-time bus information systems in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. A face-to-face paper-based survey was conducted to collect the data. Various statistics and methods, such as ANOVA tests, ordinal regression and binary logistic regression, were used to analyse the data. The results showed that 35.5% of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that the current information system deterred or discouraged them from using public transport. In addition, a significant portion of respondents (82%) stated that they board the first arriving bus, even though it may take a longer in-vehicle time to complete the trip, because of uncertainty regarding the arrival time of the next alternative bus with a shorter in-vehicle travel time. A majority of the respondents (88%) indicated that real-time transit information would not be necessary if bus headways are less than 10minutes. As for preferred information content, information on the next bus arrival time received the highest priority. In general, Light Rail Transit (LRT) users showed the least interest in real-time information. Women, younger riders, current car users and infrequent transit users showed a higher interest in real-time information. Display boards at bus stops were perceived to be the most preferred medium to get en-route information, whereas a website/call centre was stated to be the preferred media for pre-trip information.

AB Anticipatory traveller information system based on variable message sign (VMS) aims to relieve recurrent and non-recurrent congestion by using predicted traffic conditions to design control strategies consistent with drivers' route choice behaviour to guide drivers through the freeway-arterial networks and improve system performance. To provide anticipatory traveller information consistent with drivers' en-route diversion behaviour and controller's objectives effectively, this study examines (i) automated calibration of the parameters of a time-variant drivers' en-route diversion model using aggregate-level data, and (ii) an active route guidance scheme, which projects the network states into the near future and determines spatiotemporal coordinated anticipatory traveller information. The proposed system is tested on real world networks. The implementation results demonstrate that the anticipatory traveller information provided by the proposed model is more consistent, and therefore easier to be accepted by drivers. The findings also reveal that the coordinated VMS-based anticipatory traveller information effectively provides guidance to drivers because it accounts for the spatial and temporal changes in traffic conditions, and encourages better use of roadway capacity, thereby resulting in better system performance over the same period of operations.

AB The Transport Systems Centre (TSC) has developed an integrated Global Positioning System (GPS)Geographical information System (GIS) for collecting on-road traffic data from a probe vehicle. This system has been further integrated with the engine management system of a vehicle to provide time-tagged data on GPS position and speed, distance travelled, acceleration, fuel consumption, engine performance. and air pollutant emissions on a second-by-second basis. These data are handled within a GIS and can be processed and queried during the data collection (from a notebook PC in the vehicle) or saved to a file for later analysis. The database so generated provides a rich source of information for studies of travel times and delays, congestion levels, and energy and emissions. A case study application of the system is described focusing on studies of congestion levels on two parallel routes in a major arterial corridor in metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia. As part of these investigations, a discussion of the nature of traffic congestion is given. This provides both a general definition of traffic congestion and the discussion of a number of parametric measures of congestion. The computation of these parameters for the study corridor on the basis of data collected from the integrated GPS-GIS system is described. The GIS provides a database management platform for the integration, display, and analysis of the data collected from GPS and the in-vehicle instrumentation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) offer travelers a number of benefits, such as reduced travel time and uncertainty and improved traffic safety. The reliability of travel time provided by ATIS has an effect on the travelers' choice of routes. However, the market for ATIS devices is a niche market, and its users may or may not follow the information and instructions provided by the system. Hence there is some information heterogeneity among travelers, which arises from the imperfect information with regard to other travelers' preferences and types. This study applies the concept of a Bayesian game to the route choice problem when travelers are maximizing their degree of satisfaction by choosing routes. A Bayesian model is used in this work to analyze the impact of this heterogeneity on travelers' route choices. We find that the use of ATIS exposes certain heterogeneities in traveler types and beliefs.

TI EFFECT OF PARKING INFORMATION ON TRAVELERS KNOWLEDGE AND BEHAVIOR
SO TRANSPORTATION
LA English

DE PARKING BEHAVIOR; REAL-TIME INFORMATION; UNITED-KINGDOM; TRAVELER
   INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB In many urban centers the demand for parking increases sharply before Christmas mainly due to shopping activity - causing parking congestion. One way to ameliorate such congestion is by disseminating parking information. Informed drivers may divert to relatively under-utilized parking facilities relieving the pressure on congested facilities. The City of Nottingham in England tested a real-time parking information system designed to alleviate congestion in the City Center parking facilities. Real-time information was disseminated through the radio, while historical information regarding parking locations was disseminated through newspaper advertisements and leaflets. The objective of this study is to assess impacts of the parking information system on travelers' knowledge and decisions.
   Survey research was used to understand traveler response. Respondents' levels of knowledge regarding car parks were analyzed by developing Poisson regression models. Drivers were more likely to have greater knowledge of city center car parks if they used several information sources (radio broadcasts, newspaper advertisements or leaflets and word-of-mouth), were active seekers of parking information, and searched for parking rather than going directly to a parking facility. In addition, the study of behavior showed that drivers were more inclined to use the relatively under-utilized Park-and-Ride facilities instead of the city center car parks if they received parking information from Newspaper advertisements/leaflets. Overall, the parking information service in Nottingham was effective; it seems reasonable to establish such information dissemination and monitoring systems at parking facilities in other urban areas. Furthermore, to support informed travel and activity participation decisions, parking information should be integrated with traffic and transit information.

AB A description is given of the efforts of the Mexican Transportation Institute (IMT) to develop a geographic information system (GIS)-based data management system for accidents on federal roads in the various states of Mexico with the purpose of achieving efficiency, reliability, and automation for handling and processing of such data. A description is also given of the use of the developed system for generating some relevant results. Some conclusions are derived. Although the former is shown only for the case of the state of Oaxaca, the procedure presented has been completed for the other states of Mexico. For development of this work, the ArcView GIS was selected after evaluating its characteristics of capacity versus price, because the resulting system will be delivered to each of the Centers of the Ministry of Communications and Transports in the states of Mexico. The system is developed by integrating into ArcView a series of data for the state considered, including cartographic representation, classification and naming of roads, traffic volume and composition, and information on accidents. The information referred to in the work corresponds to 1997.

AB This paper describes a methodology for validating online dynamic O-D matrix estimation models using loop detector data in large-scale transportation networks. The simulation procedure focuses on travel aspects related to the collective trip structure of users, including the amount and duration of trips between O-D pairs, trip departure rates, average travel time from each origin and combinations of them. The analysis identifies emerging systematic patterns between these factors and issues related to the model performance, including network scale effects. This procedure aims to enhance the usage of prior O-D information based on, e.g. travel surveys, that are typically used in the estimation process. Moreover, it seeks to integrate the validation of dynamic O-D matrix estimation models with strategies for identifying target population groups for online planning and assessment of real-time travel information services within the context of Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS).

ID INTERFACE
AB The potential of in-vehicle information systems (IVISs) to cause driver distraction highlights the need to ensure that such systems are designed in such a way that driver safety is not compromised. The human-centred design approach has much to offer in this regard. Central to this approach is that interface design is an iterative process, and that information on usability is collected as part of this process thus helping to inform system design. This study presents a case study, where the usability of three IVIS display presentation concepts for a music selection device was examined in each of the two phases of design iteration. In Phase 1, data on usability were collected through a cognitive walkthrough approach involving four human factors experts. In Phase 2, data were collected as part of an experimental lab-based study involving 30 potential users. The approach was effective in highlighting areas for design improvement and was sufficiently sensitive in differentiating the concepts on the basis of their usability. Suggestions for a further phase of usability evaluation as part of a subsequent IVIS design iteration are offered.

AB Highway corridor alignment presents a highly complex decision environment in which a variety of social, environmental, and economic factors must be defined and weighted and trade-offs must be evaluated. These data vary widely in format and quality. Stakeholders from various groups, often with competing interests, should be integrated into this process efficiently to determine objectives, to select data, and then to quantify the importance. Corridor planning is therefore an appropriate domain for the development and application of enhanced methodologies that conjoin multicriteria decision-support techniques with the spatial analytic and presentation capacities of a geographic information system. The analytic minimum impedance surface (AMIS) methodology is presented, and its application to a case study in the southeastern United States is evaluated. ANUS features the structured integration of stakeholder input into a hybrid analytic hierarchy process. The advantages of the approach are highlighted, along with the significance of process design in building an effective methodology. Several potential applications are discussed. Conceptual constraints and problems related to the implementation of ANUS are set forth, and future enhancements are posited.

AB Geographic information systems (GIS) technology has been discussed for managing traffic accident data for years. However, its usefulness for analyzing truck accidents has not been explored extensively. Because GIS has spatial referencing and graphical display features, it would be useful to link relevant accident information to assist in information management and safety analysis. Used with other analysis technologies, GIS can help identify factors that contribute to accidents at specific locations and to identify countermeasures. The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) has comprehensive electronic databases, including roadway networks, truck accident records, roadway geometry, and other relevant information, but use of this information remains at the level of database management. Integration of truck accident information into a GIS is a low-cost, high-benefit way to analyze factors that affect truck accidents and their associated mitigation measures. The analytical ability of a GIS-based truck accident information management system developed for NJDOT is presented.

TI Where does carsharing work? Using geographic information systems to

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB A tool to assess the market potential for new carsharing operations in urban communities is examined and applied. The research is based on the analysis conducted for TCRP Report 108: Carsharing: Where and How It Succeeds. Geographic market segments in urban areas are analyzed. A geographic information system (GIS)-based analysis of 13 U.S. regions finds that neighborhood and transportation characteristics are more important indicators for carsharing success than the individual demographics of carsharing members. Results indicate that low vehicle ownership has the strongest, most consistent correlation to the amount of carsharing service in a neighborhood. Thresholds based on analysis results are outlined for low service (i.e., carsharing may be viable but limited growth can be expected) and high service (i.e., carsharing is likely to flourish). This tool to identify neighborhoods that can support carsharing is applied to a community seeking to establish a carsharing program: Austin, Texas. The analysis finds that several Austin neighborhoods have the characteristics to support carsharing (e.g., low vehicle ownership rates and high percentages of one-person households), but few Austin neighborhoods could support a high level of carsharing service.

ID OPERATING SPEED; CONSISTENCY
AB Given the high number of crashes occurring on highways, it is necessary to intensify the search for new tools that assist in understanding their causes. With this aim in mind, the authors have developed a computer system, named Highway Design Analysis (HDA), which analyses the relationship between the geometric characteristics of a highway and those characteristics that the driver expects to find. The system is based on the analysis of vehicles' operating speed and allows the selection of the operating speed prediction model to be used. Several speed prediction models, including the model developed in Spain in the current study, have been used in the case study. The information generated by the application developed has been integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) with the purpose of manipulating, analysing and showing the results in a more efficient way. The system developed is discussed along with its application to three highways.

TI Truck Diversion Routing Using Geographic Information Systems
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The objective of this paper is to develop an analytical model to identify key Interstate segments at which trucks are frequently diverted because of a disruption in service and to determine an appropriate alternate route under such circumstances. Through the use of a risk-based approach, segments of the Tennessee Interstate system were selected according to histories of serious incidents, incidents with diversions, and high truck volumes. In the selection of a preferred diversion route, the shortest alternate path may not be feasible for truck use because of varying size and performance characteristics. To address this consideration, a geographic information system (GIS) was used; in the GIS, restrictions and costs were applied to candidate diversion routes to either eliminate or penalize routes undergoing evaluation. The alternate route assessment methodology illustrates the need for improvements in nationwide truck freight networks as well as the ability for GIS tools to address complex routing problems. Most alternate routes studied as part of this project were affected by these restrictions. Use of this methodology can lead to reduced congestion and increased reliability in travel time for trucks and other vehicular traffic.

AB Guidelines that were adopted for the implementation of the highway traveller information system ( HTIS) in the Jiangsu province of China are presented. Framework design is discussed including HTIS architecture and functional requirements. The HTIS architecture levels, of which there are seven, are illustrated and the major functions of each logical level are discussed. Analysis is made of three topology patterns ( centralised topology, distributed topology and hybrid topology) of the HTIS, and the topology framework based on hybrid topology is presented accordingly. Furthermore, the layout framework of the Jiangsu province HTIS with consideration of the freeway network and normal highway network. This layout framework establishes the foundation for further development of the Jiangsu province HTIS.

   INFORMATION
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article
ID STRATEGIES; MODEL
AB This paper considers information systems in public transit in which the passenger information in real time regarding projected vehicle travel times. Such information systems may have value to passengers in situations where they may choose among different origin-to-destination paths. To provide a preliminary assessment of these systems, an analytic framework is presented to evaluate path choices and travel time benefits resulting from real-time information. A behavioral model of transit path choice is presented that frames the choice in terms of a decision whether to board a departing vehicle. Furthermore, this path choice model accommodates network travel times that are both stochastic and time-dependent, two elements that have been neglected in previous studies but are critical to evaluating real-time information systems. The path choice model is extended to demonstrate how real-time information may be incorporated by the passenger in making a path choice decision. This analytic framework is applied to a case study corridor at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), using a computer simulation to model vehicle movements and passenger path choices in the corridor. The results suggest that realtime information yields only very modest improvements in passenger service measures such as the origin-to-destination travel times and the variability of trip times. Based on this analysis, the quantitative benefits of real-time information for transit passenger path choices appear to be questionable.

AB This paper proposes a model for assessing the effects of the integrated implementation of en-route transit information systems (ETIS) and time-varying transit pricing systems (TTPS). The proposed model reveals the interaction between ETIS and TTPS, and the potential benefit of the joint implementation. There are two classes of passengers: those equipped and those unequipped with ETIS. It is assumed that unequipped passengers make their travel choices according to stochastic dynamic user optimal principles, with equipped passengers having a lower perception variation of travel cost due to the availability of better information. A bi-level program is formulated to model the integrated effects on passengers' departure time choice behavior, route choice behavior, transit network performance, and transit operators' revenue. The lower level is a multi-class stochastic dynamic transit assignment model. The combined system total cost and operators' benefits under varied transit conditions are investigated with a numerical example.

TI Safety Impact of Pavement Conditions
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
AB Pavement condition has been known as a key factor related to ride quality, but it is less clear how pavement condition is related to traffic crashes. The researchers used a geographic information system to link data from the Texas Department of Transportation crash record information system and the pavement management information system. Linking the data provided an opportunity to examine in depth the impact of pavement conditions on traffic crashes. This study analyzed the correlation between four key pavement condition scores and crash rates on a large number of crashes on Texas asphalt nonfreeway roadways between 2008 and 2009. The results overwhelmingly suggest that very good pavement conditions coincide with much lower crash rates compared with very poor conditions. The findings of this study provide insights into how pavement conditions might affect crash rates on different types of roadways. The study also provides critical knowledge that may lead to improvements in safety-oriented pavement design. Because of funding shortages, many state roadways suffer severe pavement deterioration, which may result in increased crash rates, as this study suggests. The findings of this study serve as scientific justification for more adequate maintenance of roadways to avoid further safety deterioration. The researchers recommend that state highway agencies maintain fair or good pavement conditions, at a minimum, on all major state highways. When possible, very good pavement conditions should be maintained to reduce crashes.

AB Intervehicle communication (IVC) is an emerging topic in research and application that is getting increasing attention from all major car manufacturers. In this paper, a novel method for scalable information dissemination in highly mobile ad hoc networks is proposed: segment-oriented data abstraction and dissemination (SODAD). With SODAD, information can be distributed in an information range multiple orders of magnitude larger than the transmission range of the air interface, even if only 1%-3% of all vehicles are equipped with an IVC system, e.g., during market introduction. By restricting the method to the dissemination of map/position-based data, scalability is achieved. In the second half of this paper, an example application for the SODAD method is presented: a self-organizing traffic-information system (SOTIS). In SOTIS, a car is equipped with a satellite navigation receiver, an IVC system, and a digital map. Each individual vehicle collects traffic information for its local area. Using the digital map, the traffic information is analyzed based on road segments. By distributing the information in the ad hoc intervehicle network using the SODAD method, a decentralized traffic information system is created. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated using network simulation with vehicular mobility models. Simulation results for typical scenarios are presented. Furthermore, a prototype implementation based on commercially available standard hardware demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach.

AB Inclement weather is a threat to the safety of transportation systems as well as the efficiency of their operation. A road weather information system (RWIS) is a network of environmental sensor stations (ESS) that collect a range of real-time data about weather and pavement conditions. These systems can support highway officials and civilians in making more informed transportation safety decisions, particularly in times of adverse weather, by giving them more accurate and localized weather information. This enables the proper maintenance activities to be executed and safety to be restored while using minimum resources. However, because of the range of network characteristics and geographical factors affecting the implementation of ESS, no widely adopted guidelines exist that outline where to implement ESS in a network beyond taking into the physical criteria of an appropriate site, although several methods have been suggested. This paper aims to take a practical approach to solving the location problem of RWIS by proposing a unified multi-objective optimization methodology that takes into account vehicular accident data, vehicle miles traveled, area coverage, access to power and maintenance, and existing ESS. This study produces an exact solution method that produces a Pareto set of multiple efficient solutions. The proposed methodology is applied to a real world case study focused on the deployment of additional ESS in the existing RWIS network across New York State. Further, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the effects of different parameters and a nonpreference solution is proposed.

TI Estimating safety benefits of road improvements: Case based approach
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
DE safety; highway improvement; case reports
AB Improvements to road safety have become a high priority for road authorities due to increasing public awareness and concern of the high social and economic costs of collisions. However, satisfying this priority in an environment of limited budgets and growing fiscal constraints is difficult. It is therefore important to ensure that the funding available for road safety improvements is efficiently utilized. In an attempt to maximize the overall road safety benefits, safety professionals usually invoke a process to evaluate the cost effectiveness of road safety projects. Road safety benefits are normally determined using collision reduction factors (CRFs) that are reported in the road safety literature. However, the results from many previous safety studies are unreliable due to the inability to apply the CRFs to all conditions and because many safety studies suffer from problems with the evaluation methodology and accommodating the random nature of collisions. To resolve these problems, safety analysis software known as the information system for estimating crash reductions (ISECR) has been developed. Information system for estimating crash reductions is an intelligent database that uses a case-based reasoning approach to compile the results from previous road safety research. Information system for estimating crash reductions evaluates the applicability of the results by accounting for site-specific characteristics and the study methodology by assigning a quality score. The system determines the expected CRFs and the range and reliability associated with a safety improvement at a specific location. The evolution of ISECR, a description of current and future enhancements, and the applications for this road safety-engineering tool are the subjects of this paper.

AB Travel speed is an important parameter for measuring road traffic. urban traffic information system (UTIS) was developed as a mobile detector for measuring link travel speeds in South Korea. However, UTIS incur errors, such as those caused by irregular vehicle trajectories and communication delays. This study describes an algorithm developed for estimating reliable and accurate average roadway link travel speeds using UTIS data. The algorithm estimates link travel times using a robust data-filtering procedure to identify valid observations within a sampling interval using a varying data validity window. The size of the data validity window varies as a function of the standard deviation of observations in previous intervals. A field test showed that the variance of the percent errors of link travel times was reduced when measured using the new model. Therefore it can be concluded that the proposed model significantly improves travel speed measuring accuracy.

ID SHORTEST LOOPLESS PATHS; TRAVEL-TIMES
AB The trip making process using transit versus private automobile differs in the use of time schedules, walking paths, transfer stops, plus issues such as fare and safety. Due to these factors, many of the standard shortest path algorithms do not apply. The purpose of this study is to develop an algorithm and strategy for transit providers to find best alternatives for the user, and to demonstrate how a geographic information system can be used in the development of transit advanced traveler information system (TATIS) to meet these needs. This paper presents a short introduction to TATIS systems, some commonly used algorithms in determining the shortest and multiple paths, and anew strategy that was developed in this study which differs from standard network algorithms. The major features of this proposed algorithm are: (1) Capability of handling multiple modes of transit; (2) providing paths that include walking distances from and to the transit path as well as between transfer points; and (3) provision of multiple optimal paths to allow the user flexibility in choosing a path.

DE short-term travel time forecasting; traffic flow simulator
ID TRAFFIC FLOW SIMULATOR
AB In this paper, a case study is carried out in Hong Kong for demonstration of the Transport Information System (TIS) prototype. A traffic flow simulator (TFS) is presented to forecast the short-term travel times that can be served as a predicted travel time database for the TIS in Hong Kong. In the TFS, a stochastic deviation coefficient is incorporated to simulate the minute-by-minute fluctuation of traffic flows within the peak hour period. The purposes of the case study are: 1) to show the applicability of the TFS for larger-scale road network; and 2) to illustrate the short-term forecasting of path travel times in practice. The results of the case study show that the TFS can be applied to real network effectively. The predicted travel times are compared with the observed travel times on the selected paths for an OD pair. The results show that the observed path travel times fall in the 90% confidence interval of the predicted path travel times.

TI Geographic information system-system dynamics procedure for bus rapid

DE bus rapid transit; transit ridership; geographic information systems;
   system dynamics
AB This paper presents a two-step procedure for estimating the total daily ridership (TDR) of a new bus rapid transit (BRT) route that runs along a corridor without a competing regular bus service. The first step of the procedure uses the Geographic Information System-Business Analyst desktop to analyze and extract the total population, employed population, housing units within 1/4mile and 1/4 to 1/2mile from the BRT stations in the base year, and their respective annual growth rates. These values are then used as inputs into the second step. The second step of the procedure uses a simulation model constructed by the system dynamics approach. This simulation model, which embeds the known relationships between the demographic variables and proposed BRT system's infrastructure and operational features, initially estimates the TDR of the base year. Simulation is then performed to estimate the TDR from the base year until a future year defined by the user. The two-step procedure has been validated with actual demographic and ridership data from the Las Vegas MAX BRT line and the Los Angeles Orange Line, respectively. The procedure has also been applied to the proposed BRT route along Mesa St. in El Paso, Texas, as a case study. The two-step procedure offers a new and relatively simple approach that complements the three known BRT ridership estimation methods currently acceptable by the U.S. Federal Transit Administration.

TI Geographic Information Systems for Estimating Coastal Maritime Risk
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The U.S. Maritime Administration made a strong commitment to short-sea shipping in 2010 in America's Marine Highway Program. There are few statistics about coastal vessel traffic, however, and even less is known about casualty rates in those waters because of the absence of trip data and the relatively poor quality of casualty data. Geographic information systems (GIS) are unique tools that enable greater visualization and understanding of complex problems. A methodology was used to adapt a GIS-based highway planning traffic assignment model for use in maritime risk assessment. The planning model routed 12 years of vessel entrance and clearance data through an international waterway network to estimate the number of trips traversing network links by any number of metrics, including year, ship type, flag of registry, and draft. The risk methodology deployed a 100-mi(2) mesh (10 mi x 10 mi) over the entire United States and coastal waters to estimate the highest casualty rate (casualties per million vessel trips) and casualty frequency locations.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHMS; DESIGN
AB Highway alignment optimization based on cost minimization requires comprehensive formulation of costs sensitive to alignment and development of efficient solution algorithms. The complexity of the applicable cost functions severely limits the search algorithms that can be employed. Recently, genetic algorithms, which can search very effectively through complex spaces with huge numbers of local optima, have been successfully developed for highway alignment optimization. However, in order to solve realworld problems the optimization algorithms should work directly with a Geographic Information System (GIS) which stores relevant geographic information, such as land boundaries, environmentally sensitive regions, and topographic data. This paper presents a model for highway alignment optimization that integrates a GIS with genetic algorithms, examines the effects of various costs on alignment selection, and explores optimization in constrained spaces that realistically reflect the limits on road improvement projects. The paper integrates several previously published developments and adds some new analysis approaches. A real-world problem using a GIS database for Maryland is solved using the proposed method. An example using an artificial map to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed model in mountainous terrain is also demonstrated. The results indicate that travel-time cost, which is often neglected by highway agencies in selecting alignments, significantly affects the alignment optimization. Computation time increases significantly with the number of properties affected by each alignment. The model can optimize alignments in mountainous terrain or regions with very complex geography.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION

DT Article
AB Despite recent interest in work related road safety, relatively little research has been conducted to examine the effects of institutional factors on fleet safety. This paper conceptualized an evaluation framework and utilized it to assess fleet coordinators' attitudes toward and the usage of a fleet safety management system. First, focus group interviews revealed that monitoring fleet safety was not considered an important task within the government agencies participating in the research. Second, similar results were obtained in a survey of the fleet coordinators, which showed that most fleet coordinators were not utilising the full diagnostic capabilities of the management information system. In particular, fleet coordinators reported significantly higher competence, usage and importance on the coordination of fleet vehicle efficiency than on the coordination of fleet safety. These results were supported by the finding that fleet coordinators were required to report more on fleet efficiency than on fleet safety.

AB At the planning stages of a highway project, various location alternatives must be explored, subject to a set of design constraints. A computerized tool with which to compare alignment alternatives would significantly reduce the time and resources spent as well as help find a minimum cost (or maximum net benefit) solution. Highway design optimization (HDO) is a computerized process that minimizes an objective function composed of significant highway costs, subject to a set of design constraints, including curvature, gradient, and sight distance. Several costs of alignments, such as right-of-way, earthwork, and environment costs, are sensitive to geography. A geographic information system (GIS) may be exploited to compute such costs for use in HDO models (HDOMs). Most known HDOMs focus only on refining the optimization approach and do not provide a comprehensive formulation for all costs sensitive to alignment. Provided is a comprehensive formulation for right-of-way cost computation. A GIS-based algorithm is developed to compute the right-of-way cost, which is integrated with an HDOM based on genetic algorithms. Two examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Providing personalized advice is an important objective in the development of advanced traveler information systems. In this paper, a Bayesian method to incorporate learning of users' personal travel preferences in a multimodal routing system is proposed. The system learns preference parameters incrementally based on travel choices a user makes. Existing Bayesian inference methods require too much computation time for the learning problem that we are dealing with here. Therefore, an approximation method is developed, which is based on sequential processing of preference parameters and systematic sampling of the parameter space. The data of repetitive travel choices of a representative sample of individuals are used to test the system. The results indicate that the system rapidly adapts to a user and learns his or her preferences effectively. The efficiency of the algorithm allows the system to handle realistically sized learning problems with short response times even when many users are to be simultaneously processed. It is therefore concluded that the approach is feasible; problems for future research are identified.

AB The authors present a framework for a geographic information systems (GIS)-based decision support system (DSS) designed to provide online routing instructions in response to updated information on traffic and weather conditions for vehicles transporting hazardous materials. Embedded within the DSS is a heuristic that exploits a spatially and temporally rolling horizon. The heuristic is implemented using standard, widely available tools to facilitate adoption by decision makers. The DSS's ability to dynamically update instructions in response to real-time information is demonstrated along the corridor between the metropolitan areas of Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland.

AB Purpose In the process of nowadays efficiency evaluation of any mode of transportation, sustainability results are the most important factor. In regard to railway sustainability, Train Control Information Systems (TCIS) are such advanced systems with important positive impacts. The main purpose of this study was therefore the evaluation of these impacts as well as the evaluation of Key Performance Themes (KPT) for sustainable railways.
   Methods Firstly a very detailed literature review of papers that have focused on TCIS and their improvements on railway sustainability, published in the scientific journal in the period from 2005 and 2016, was performed. The number of studies was then used as a main criteria in Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) evaluations or rankings of these systems and their impacts.
   Results The paper offers results from the first systematic review of papers which investigate the role of TCIS in terms of sustainability and, additionally, represents a refined approach to TCIS classification with a new classes descriptions. During review KPT for sustainable railways were also identified. Further, AHP evaluated the Train Management and Interlocking Systems and their subsystems as the most important TCIS, and safety and costs of equipment, installation, maintenance and operation as the most important themes.
   Conclusions The results are important for both, scholars for their future research and for other railway stakeholders and decision makers, who must select different systems and technologies for implementation in their railway systems with emphasis on increasing performance and sustainability. The study offers also the opportunities for further research in regard to railway sustainability.

AB The effect of the application of advanced transport information system (ATIS) and road pricing is studied in a transportation system under non-recurrent congestion. A stochastic network deterministic user equilibrium model (SNDUE) with elastic demand is formulated and used to evaluate the welfare and private impacts of different market penetrations of ATIS, together with road pricing for a simple network. Both marginal first-best road pricing and a second-best fixed road pricing are considered. The incentives of private users to use ATIS are analyzed and the characteristics of optimum tolls as a function of ATIS market penetration are shown. We conclude that ATIS is an efficient and necessary tool to reduce the effects of non-recurrent incidents in a transportation network, especially when non-recurrent congestion causes a significant deterioration of operational conditions of the network. If the impact of non-recurrent incidents on free flow costs is small or is reduced only to congestion effects, the use of road pricing would be more efficient. Social benefits obtained when jointly implementing ATIS and road pricing are practically the same whether first-best or second-best road pricing is used. Considering the private costs perceived by the network users, and the benefits experienced by equipped users, the maximum level of market penetration achieved could be limited because private benefits disappear after certain market penetration is obtained.

AB This paper discusses the areawide Dynamic Road traffic NoisE (DRONE) simulator, and its implementation as a tool for noise abatement policy evaluation. DRONE involves integrating a road traffic noise estimation model with a traffic simulator to estimate road traffic noise in urban networks. An integrated traffic simulation-noise estimation model provides an interface for direct input of traffic flow properties from simulation model to noise estimation model that in turn estimates the noise on a spatial and temporal scale. The output from DRONE is linked with a geographical information system for visual representation of noise levels in the form of noise contour maps. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems have great potential to improve driver information services. In this study, field test results of the COOPERS project were analysed to compare driver behavioural responses to warning/information provided by the COOPERS in-vehicle information systems against existing roadside information systems. Based on the analysis, it was found that with the COOPERS system, the test drivers slowed down earlier when approaching roadworks and better complied with the reduced speed limits applied through the roadwork zone than those when without the COOPERS system. Post-test questionnaire results showed that drivers like COOPERS services/systems, particularly the feature of indicating distance to the event site in the messaging.

TI Substitution or Complementarity Examination of Ridership Effects of
   Real-Time Bus Information on Transit Rail in Chicago, Illinois
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSPORT; WEATHER; IMPACT
AB The effects of a real-time bus information system, Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) Bus Tracker, on the ridership of the CTA transit rail system in Chicago, Illinois, are examined with panel data on monthly average weekday ridership at each transit train station in the entire CTA system from January 2005 through December 2010. Other factors that might contribute to changes in CTA rail ridership (e.g., socioeconomic situation, transit service, and weather) are controlled. Results of a mixed linear model indicate that Bus Tracker service increases CTA train ridership. This increase might be attributable to the increased intermodal transfer efficiency between CTA buses and trains that results from the real-time bus information provided. Findings suggest that the complementarity effect of providing real-time bus information outweighs its substitution effect on the ridership of a connected transit rail system. Together with the findings from an earlier study (which show that Bus Tracker service helps to increase bus ridership), study results provide empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis that implementation of a real-time transit information system leads to gains in transit ridership.

TI Maine Statewide Deployment and Integration of Advanced Traveler
   Information Systems
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) are new to the state of Maine, and there are many unanswered questions about their effect on motorists. Dynamic message signs, variable speed limit signs (VSLS), and overheight vehicle detection (OHVD) systems are key components of ATIS and are the means through which motorists can be provided with en route information pertinent to their travels. Speed data were collected during inclement weather events to determine the effect of VSLS on traveler speed. Speeds were collected during storms of different intensities. The data suggest that motorists adjust their speed to conditions and what they think is appropriate. This finding is also supported by survey responses. The fact that motorists do not slow down to the posted speed could be partly because of the VSLS not being enforced. An ORVD system installed in Bangor, Maine, in August 2006 has shown potential, with no hits to the I-95 overpass since installation. Part of the study consisted of identifying and evaluating the institutional issues and barriers associated with intelligent transportation system deployment. These issues include long-term funding commitments for ATIS, acceptable messaging, integration of information databases, interagency coordination, enforcement, and education of the public.

ID MOTORWAYS; PERFORMANCE; EQUATIONS
AB The research presented here evaluated road safety on the road sections included in the Intelligent Traffic Control System of the Podhale Region (ISSRRP) in Poland. This travel time information system consists of a remote traffic microwave sensor, cameras, as well as automatic plate number recognition on national roads with variable message signs and a mobile app to suggest alternative routes in the regional road network. The study analyzed changes in safety caused by transferring traffic volume from national to regional rural and suburban road networks. The assessment of the safety performance was performed with an empirical Bayes study, with periods of three years before and after the implementation of ISSRRP. No changes were identified in the safety performance of the national road network after to the introduction of ISSRRP. However, when the overall network is considered, a potential increase in the number of crashes may be expected, depending on the volume of traffic transferred from national to regional roads, and rural or suburban areas. Therefore, a new approach for system management was proposed, taking into account not only improvement in traffic flow, but also safety performance.

AB Updating and maintaining geographic information systems-transportation (GIS-T) data is proving difficult. Different database formats needed to support diverse applications lead to inconsistencies and inaccuracies and to duplication in updating. A clearinghouse approach is recommended for the collection and dissemination of new transportation features. This clearinghouse allows users to control the selection and segmentation of transportation features to update existing GIS-T databases to meet the needs of various private and public applications. Day-forward updating is recommended as the most appropriate technique for supporting existing systems without having to impose a new data model or a common identification schema. This approach is advantageous in that it is based on collecting data about new or changed transportation features once and uses the data many times to update existing databases. Four case studies are proposed as proof of concept and to pilot the day-forward GIS-T data-sharing clearinghouse concept.

AB Transportation improvement site selection exemplifies transportation decision making that is collaborative in nature and geographically based. Such decision-making is part of a broad societal trend toward shared and participatory discussions about public investment. Perspectives from three different transportation decision contexts in the Puget Sound Region of Washington State, a regional council, a county government and a public-private Coalition group, are combined with a literature review to develop a decision task model that summarizes the need for information technology support during transportation improvement site selection. The task model guides the development of a decision support system requirement specification that outlines integrated information capabilities provided by geographic information system (GIS) and group support system (GSS) technologies. Together, GIS and GSS capabilities contribute to evolving group-based GIS. The kinds of capabilities a group-based GIS could offer in addressing the needs are identified. A report on the use of a prototype, group-based GIS called Spatial Group Choice highlights the possibilities in an inter-organizational coalition decision context. The conclusions discuss needs for future technology developments and social-behavioral science studies on these developments. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An integrated space-time environment is demanded by activity-based travel studies to facilitate the investigation of spatial and temporal characteristics of activities. The current geographic information system (GIS), which has been successful in supporting trip-based travel analysis, does not include an explicit time representation and therefore is incapable of supporting activity-based travel analysis efficiently. This study proposes a temporal GIS design that incorporates the space-time path concept of Hagerstrand's time geography to facilitate the analysis of activities in a space-time context. The space-time path concept provides an efficient approach to organizing activities and travels in their space-time contexts and to supporting the investigation of spatiotemporal relationships between individuals. This study adopts the three-dimensional orthogonal space-time system in the temporal GIS design and develops representation and analysis functions related to space-time paths and individual activities. The proposed design is successfully implemented in a prototype system. The system provides an integrated space-time environment to effectively visualize activities and travels in their space-time contexts and analyze their spatiotemporal characteristics. Such a system offers useful tools to facilitate activity-based travel studies.

AB In this study we seek to understand the relation between travel information, transit use intentions and night travel. We hypothesize that transit use is related to the perceived usefulness and the ease-of-use of the system, which are related to information quality and real-time information availability. The hypothesized relations are anchored theoretically in the Technology Acceptance Model and validated empirically in two case-studies: (i) Copenhagen (Denmark), characterized by a highly integrated transit system with an advanced web-based information system; (ii) Recife and Natal (Brazil), characterized by a lower perceived level-of-service and non-integrated information sources. Data from a tailor-made survey of 1123 university students were collected. Structural equation models were employed for explaining the use of transit as a function of the observed respondent characteristics and the latent constructs. The results show that: (i) information search quality and source explain transit use; (ii) information quality underlies level-of-service and familiarity; (iii) the use of real-time information links to information quality and familiarity; (iv) general transit use and non-routine use during night and to unfamiliar places are correlated; and (v) the behavioral framework is confirmed with the two case-studies.

AB An end-user query of a Geographical Information System (GIS) can formally be defined as the application of a set of operators (spatial or not). Geographical Information Systems used for Transportation (GIS-T) must provide a path evaluation operator. For example, an end-user query may involve a selection based on alphanumeric criteria, an evaluation of path, and a spatial intersection. This composition of operators and the fact that the evaluation of a path may not provide a unique result impose the definition of a query resolution model or a database query language able to support this composition. In this paper we present a query resolution model. The use of multi-criteria analysis and the definition of aggregates in a query (nearly mandatory) may involve ambiguities in the final presentation of the results to an end-user. The formal modeling of query results must take into account this risk. The philosophies of a query definition and the presentation of the results may be different (e.g., formular vs visual). The management of query results must take into account the data model associated with the query results, the results themselves (metabase/database), and the interpretation. The interpretation avoids errors due to visual ambiguities of an operator with an aggregate function. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a novel framework for developing a real-time bus arrival time information system, using crowdsourced bus information contributed by bus passengers. On the one hand, passengers can derive the real-time information via their smartphones. On the other hand, they can provide some bus data in return. Particular characteristics of the participatory-based bus data are introduced. Also, a number of data processing steps are proposed in the framework to handle the data characteristics, which pose extra difficulties in real-time bus arrival time prediction. The proposed system is evaluated using simulated bus data sets. Practicality of the system is investigated in terms of prediction accuracy based on different participation percentages of bus passengers.

AB The heterogeneous driving behaviors from different travelers are not considered in current advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) such as Google Maps and 511 systems, which leads the systems to generate the same travel time for everyone who inputs the same origin and destination. This paper explores the modeling of individualized travel time based on the individual behavior of each driver as opposed to average traffic information, with the ultimate goal of enabling individualized traffic information provision for the ATIS and subsequently reducing travel-time prediction errors. A back propagation neural network model was built to quantitatively estimate the driving behavior differences (i.e., the delta) between individual drivers and the surrounding traffic, with both roadway geometrics and dynamic traffic conditions considered in the modeling process. A travel-time estimation algorithm is then proposed to derive link-level traffic information that considers individual behavioral difference. Finally, individualized route travel time is computed for each traveler based on the derived link-level traffic information and individual behavioral difference. The proposed model is implemented and tested on an open-source Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset, which demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model. The proposed model has the potential of being directly applied to enhance existing ATIS travel-time prediction accuracies.

AB This paper addresses various aspects related to the design, development, and validation of a web-based information system that is intended to facilitate the management of a bus transportation service offered by a Jordanian university to its staff and students. Passengers can use this system to track bus trips to find out how far a desired bus is from a specific location. Also, they can know about arrivals and departures of buses managed using this system. Specifically, this work explores UI design, data structures, database design, system architecture, and development methods to realize the required features (e.g., user roles, bus setup, driver assignment, bus routes, bus schedules, and trip monitoring) in the proposed bus location tracking system. It also suggests using the free open-source API, rather than the proprietary Google Maps API, to develop the interactive maps. The system also records trip information and solicits passenger feedback to allow reviewing and analyzing that data to enhance the quality of service, reduce operation cost, and improve passenger satisfaction. The conducted comparative analysis results illustrate that the open-source API is accurate, fast, and responsive similar to the proprietary API. Furthermore, the user survey output confirms that the deployed system is easy to use, helpful, fast, responsive, and accurate.

AB Planning of transportation infrastructure requires analyzing combinations of many different types of geospatial information (maps). Conventional Geographic Information Systems (GIS) or Computer Aided Design systems limit the planner's ability to perceive and effectively use multiple data layers together. To improve the planner's ability to interact with multiple layers of disparate spatial information, we present a novel computer system, which combines vision with haptics (touch) and sound. In this new form of Multi-Sensory Information System (MSIS), visual information is augmented by a three-dimensional haptic device (PHANToM) and by sound (sonification). In a recent study, we investigated how engineering students used this multi-sensory GIS for planning the location (the alignment) of a new road. The results indicate that certain forms of vision, haptics, and audio were used preferentially to represent certain types of spatial data. A generalization of such a multi-sensory approach could provide researchers with the basis for further development and, eventually, the augmentation of established procedures with the MSIS in highway location planning and related areas.

AB The widespread application of geographic information systems (GISs) at airports is detailed through surveys of U.S. airports. A recent survey conducted through the Airport GIS Committee of the American Association of Airport Executives indicated that more than 60 percent of airports use GISs or plan to use GISs within the next 3 years. The application of GISs for infrastructure management, environmental analysis, and airport operations is becoming commonplace at larger U.S. airports. Integration of infrastructure management in general and pavement management in particular with airportwide GISs provides far greater management capabilities than traditional infrastructure management systems. The development of integrated airport GISs and the availability of affordable, differentially corrected Global Positioning System receivers have resulted in a paradigm shift in methods of infrastructure management. As the new millennium approaches, the state of the art in infrastructure and pavement management is turning away from the traditional forms toward map-based systems that have sophisticated analytical tools. In the case of pavement management, the use of map-based analysis will overcome many of the shortcomings of the traditional MicroPAVER inspection process. The capabilities of the current state of the art in pavement management are detailed.

TI Geographic Information System Tool for Enhancing Administration of
   Overweight-Vehicle Permits
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Highway agencies impose permit fees for overweight vehicles both to recuperate (partially) the consumption cost and to encourage the use of less-damaging loading patterns and vehicle configurations. To provide information for such policies, numerous state and national studies have investigated the impacts of overweight vehicles on the physical and operational condition of highway infrastructure, including the consumption (damage) because of overweight vehicles. These studies, which largely addressed truck size and weight, highway cost allocation, or damage cost estimation, have alluded to the onerous challenge of collating permit data with existing pavement and bridge inventory data. Most previous research has relied on aggregate data to overcome this difficulty. The current study details the use of a geographic information system (GIS) tool developed to determine the infrastructure consumption at a disaggregate level. The tool was used to estimate the infrastructure consumption for individual permit records as part of a larger study that analyzed highway infrastructure consumption and revenue generation associated with overweight-vehicle operations in Indiana. The tool may be used in other contexts to administer overweight-vehicle permits, in addition to its use in impact evaluation. Finally, benefits and implications of using GIS technology in the administration of overweight-vehicle permits are discussed.

AB Transportation network data structures must be designed to meet the requirements of the analyses being conducted and must be compatible with the selected graphical user interface. Increasing interest in geographic information systems (GIS) and Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have further burdened the network data structure. It is possible to implement object oriented programming (OOP) technology to satisfy these needs, without making the data structure excessively complicated.
   This paper shows how a well-developed network data structure can incorporate major capabilities normally associated with stand-alone GIS's. The design of a network data structure derives from both theoretical and practical considerations. A design of a network data structure, composed entirely of objects, is presented. Examples of its implementation, limitations, advantages, and possible extensions are drawn from experience with the General Network Editor (GNE).

AB In this article, the relationships among technology ownership and availability, Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) awareness, and ATIS frequency of use are examined. The four main media considered are the Internet, television, radio, and telephone/other. Awareness and use of ATIS through the four media considered here are different for different users. They also change as household and person characteristics change over time. Since Information and (tele)Communication Technology (ICT) adoption is changing rapidly, this has a significant positive effect on Internet-based ATIS but not a clearly negative effect on all other media. The relationship between awareness and use appears to be nonlinear and dependent on the medium considered. Evidence of substitution between television and Internet and enhancement among other media were also found in this study.

DE scenic byways; tourism; route choice; information systems
AB In order to develop more effective tourist information systems for use along scenic byways, it is important to know the characteristics of those people who include the presence of scenic byways in their selections of routes. Gaining a better understanding of these characteristics was the purpose of this study. The data presented here are from a United States (US) survey of the driving tourist's information needs and preferences weighted to be representative of US tourist travelers. The study showed that when planning a route to a destination on an overnight automobile trip, the driving tourist is most concerned with factors related to the actual driving of the route, such as the directness, safety, amount of congestion, and distance. Of secondary importance are factors that make the route entertaining or pleasant to drive, including whether the route is a scenic byway. Analysis of the importance of scenic byways by several demographic factors showed little difference in importance ratings except for age and household income. Examination of importance ratings by trip characteristics showed that the presence of scenic byways in selecting a route was more important for the traveler whose trip purpose is a vacation, who is in the midst of a long distance and duration trip, who will be either camping or staying in a hotel, and who has planned the trip well in advance. These results suggest that scenic byways are an excellent area for the implementation and testing of in-vehicle information systems for the driving tourist. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID IMPACTS
AB This paper discusses three nationwide surveys designed to obtain user information requirements for an advanced traveler information system (ATIS) and the ATIS portion of commercial vehicle operations (CVO). A description of the survey methodology for targeting the three populations-private vehicle drivers, commercial vehicle drivers, and commercial vehicle operators-is provided, as well as the implications for the design of ATIS based on driving behavior and preference. Analysis of the data from the 1,610 returned surveys revealed that commercial drivers and private drivers valued road and traffic information as the most important ATIS service, whereas commercial vehicle operators (or dispatchers) valued the ability to have two-way communication as most important. This study also revealed that dispatchers were willing to pay significantly more for an ATIS than drivers. Finally, the data indicated that, of the four main nationwide geographical areas considered in the survey, no differences in response to the survey questions were observed. Implications of the results for the design of ATIS are discussed.

TI Analytic Hierarchy Process and Geographic Information Systems to
   Identify Optimal Transit Alignments
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Honolulu, Hawaii, like other urbanized centers, is struggling to solve problems of transportation supply and demand. One proposed solution is construction of a fixed-rail transit system along the east west corridor, to connect the western part of the county to the downtown work zones. Setting up a transit alignment that meets technical, social, economical, and environmental considerations is a challenge. This study coupled the technologies of analytic hierarchy process (AMP) and geographic information systems (GIS) to assist in the decision-making process of determining optimal transit alignment between the competing Salt Lake and Airport alignments in Honolulu. The goal of the AHP structure was to determine the location for the transit alignment: technical, social, economical, and environmental considerations are the criteria, and suitability levels are the alternatives. A uniform grid structure was developed: thematic maps related to the independent variables were converted into a 0.1-square-mile grid map. The grid data and survey results were entered into the AHP structure to produce an index of suitability that could be plotted in the GIS environment to indicate optimal alignments for the rail transit system on the basis of public preferences and technical criteria.

TI Cross-regional in-vehicle information system design: the preferences and
   comprehension of Australian, US and Chinese drivers
SO IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB The increasing global distribution of automobiles necessitates that the design of in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) is appropriate for the regions to which they are being exported. Differences between regions such as culture, language, environment and traffic context can have important influences on the usability and acceptance of IVIS and, as a consequence, on driving performance and safety. This pilot study examined the cross-regional factors that may influence IVIS preferences and comprehension, across three regions: Australia, China and the United States. The study used an online questionnaire to examine drivers' preferences for, and comprehension of, a range of surface-level aspects of IVIS interfaces. Cross-regional factors including cultural values, demographic and driving pattern data were also collected. The study was conducted locally within Australia, employing a sample of recently migrated American and Chinese and local Australian students. Regional differences were found in terms of current technology use, preferences for IVIS input control types and labels, and in the recognition and comprehension of IVIS functions and features. These findings are discussed within the framework of relevant regional differences. Based on the findings, a number of general and region-specific IVIS design recommendations are offered.

TI Highway Safety Metrics Implementation and Evaluation Using a Geographic
   Information System-Based Screening Tool
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Approximately 94.6% of the land area in the United States is termed rural or open space. Although the geographic size of this area is enormous, rural counties, towns, and villages are less likely than other locations to have sophisticated resources dedicated to road maintenance and safety. Through geographic information system (GIS) techniques and increased data availability, a data-driven approach to screening rural roadways has become an effective way to prioritize the use of limited highway safety funds for potential improvements. A GIS-based screening tool was developed with cutting-edge techniques, which included sliding window analysis and empirical Bayesian statistics. The screening tool implements these analytical methods, while taking advantage of GIS spatial computing techniques. A simple user interface aids in processing. Intended to simplify implementation by practicing professionals, the tool is designed to make use of existing geometric and law enforcement crash response data reporting, which is normally available to roadway authorities. The developed tool offers an efficient solution to several rural safety prioritization challenges by providing an effective way to screen the use of existing data. This tool implements screening methods on the basis of both modeling and crash counts, and offers flexible and accurate prioritization options for safety engineers.

AB A parking information system consisting of a parking information website and roadside displays has been proposed for New York City to alleviate parking difficulties. To justify the implementation of such a system, it is necessary to investigate parking search time and its relationship with parking information. In addition, the parking information items needed for the website and roadside displays and the target markets for this information must be identified. In the investigation, a survey was conducted to collect data on parkers' demographic and trip characteristics. On the basis of the collected data, the effect of parking information on parking search time was studied, and an ordered probit model was developed. To identify parking information needs, the analysis of variance method was employed to determine the rank of the information items for the website and roadside displays. The profiles of the parkers were also identified for each information item using developed models. The results of the investigation indicated that parking search time is significantly influenced by the amount of parking information parkers possess before starting their trips. Six information items were identified to be the most necessary for the parking information website, and five as most necessary for the parking roadside display. All these information items should be considered when designing a parking information system.

AB Current geographical information systems (GIS) are not well adapted to the management of very dynamic geographical phenomena. This is due to the lack of conceptual and physical interoperability with real-time computing facilities. The research described in this paper is oriented towards the identification and experimentation of a new methodological and applied framework for the real-time integration, manipulation and visualisation of urban traffic data. It is based on proactive interaction between the spatiotemporal database and visualisation levels, and between the visualisation and end-user levels. The proposed framework integrates different spatial and temporal levels of granularity during the analysis of urban traffic data. Urban traffic behaviours are analysed either by observation of the movements of several vehicles in space, or by changes in urban network properties (i.e., micro- versus macro-modelling). Visualisation and interaction tools together constitute a flexible interface environment for the visualisation of urban traffic data within GIS. These concepts provide a relevant support for the visual analysis of urban traffic patterns in the thematic, spatial and temporal dimensions. This integrated framework is illustrated by an experimental prototype developed in a large town in the UK. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Motorists traveling through work zones are faced with both routine and unexpected tasks of driving coupled with additional distractions provided by the work zone. This can create conflicts despite significant applications of work zone traffic-control devices. When one or more through-trafric lanes are closed and traffic volumes exceed the capacity of merge points or of the reduced number of lanes, congestion can lead to the formation of queues, which result in delays and increased potential for crashes. An automated work zone information system (AWIS) may be implemented at a work zone to notify approaching motorists of changing traffic conditions, such as slowdowns or backups. Research was conducted at rural work zones in Arkansas on I-40, where two lanes of traffic in a direction were reduced to one lane. The objectives were to compare the displays of an AWIS with field observations of traffic conditions and to determine at what volume backups were forming. AWIS was compared with field observations for-two traffic speeds, 30 and 50 mph. At M mph, the speed at which the system was programmed to identify a backup, AWIS concurred with the field observations 92% of the time. For a perceived backup speed of 50 mph, the system indicated a backup about 88% of the time. Backups formed at short-term flow rates as low as 800 to 900 passenger car equivalents per hour, which is lower than the capacities reported in the literature (1,100 to over 2,000 vehicles per hour).

TI Advanced Traveler Information System for Guiding Route Choice to Ocean

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
AB A real-time advanced traveler information system for traffic heading to Ocean City, Maryland, is presented. It can provide dynamic route choice guidance for en route travelers, offer web-based historical data for pretrip tourists, and perform real-time traffic monitoring as well as emergency evacuation for responsible agencies with its 40 detectors. The proposed system is designed to contend with most critical issues associated with real-time operations, including automated detection of incidents, reliable estimation of missing data, and continuous updates of historical databases. Implementation results demonstrate that the travel time information displayed by the proposed system has been well received by drivers and is viewed as the primary resource for choice of routes to Ocean City. The evolution of traffic volumes on alternative routes during congested periods reveals that the travel time information from variable message signs not only provides guidance to drivers but also leads to better use of roadway capacity and results in more throughputs for the same period of operation.

ID TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; TRIP DISTRIBUTION
AB Travel demand analyses are useful for transportation planning and policy development in a study area. However, travel demand modeling faces two obstacles. First, standard practice solves the four travel components (trip generation, trip distribution, modal split and network assignment) in a sequential manner. This can result in inconsistencies and non-convergence. Second, the data required are often complex and difficult to manage. Recent advances in formal methods for network equilibrium-based travel demand modeling and computational platforms for spatial data handling can overcome these obstacles. In this paper we report on the development of a prototype geographic information system (GIS) design to support network equilibrium-based travel demand models. The GIS design has several key features, including: (i) realistic representation of the multimodal transportation network, (ii) increased likelihood of database integrity after updates, (iii) effective user interfaces, and (iv) efficient implementation of network equilibrium solution algorithms.

AB Although standard procedures and methods are available for many aspects of geotechnical site characterization, the quality of the results of such activities can be highly variable because of a variety of factors, including limitations resulting from the test procedures. For initial projects, the nature of these limitations as well as their likely consequences can be reasonably accommodated; however, subsequent use of the same data in a later study may not have the benefit of this project-specific insight, particularly if the data have been archived in a digital database. Consequently, a technique for quantifying data quality is necessary. A geographical information system (GIS)-based methodology has been developed to allow for the evaluation of borehole log quality as a function of its intended use. The methodology uses a flexible hierarchical model to provide a quantitative measure of quality. The quality of the discrete boreholes distributed across a site can then be analyzed spatially within a GIS to provide a more complete assessment of quality for the entire project. This framework also allows for evaluation of the effect of additional borehole logs at a site and can be used to optimize such planning activities in a virtual environment.

AB We consider a specific advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) whose objective is to reduce drivers' travel time uncertainty with recurrent network congestion through provision of traffic information. Since the provided information is still partial or imperfect, drivers equipped with an ATIS cannot always find the shortest travel time route and thus may not always comply with the advice provided by ATIS. Thus, there are three classes of drivers on a specific day: drivers without ATIS, drivers with ATIS but without compliance with ATIS advice, drivers with ATIS and in compliance with ATIS advice. All three classes of drivers make route choice in a stochastic manner, but with different degree of uncertainty of travel time on the network. In this paper we investigate the interactions among the three classes of drivers in an ATIS environment using a multiple behavior stochastic user equilibrium model. By assuming that the market penetration of ATIS is an increasing function of the actual private gain (time saving minus the cost associated with system use) derived from ATIS service, and the ATIS compliance rate of equipped drivers is given as the probability of the actual travel time of complied drivers being less than that of non-complied drivers, we determine the equilibrium market penetration and compliance rate of ATIS and the resulting equilibrium network flow pattern using an iterative solution procedure.

AB The concepts of human information processing provide design recommendations for advanced traveler information systems (ATISs). A driver's information processing model for the ATIS environment is proposed. This qualitative model explicitly depicts how drivers process ATIS information, from the moment it is received until a decision is made in response to the information. The model is supported by data collected with a driving simulator. The results of the driving simulator study indicate that, because of the limitations of human memory, drivers prefer to have short, simple ATIS information conveyed to them whenever the circumstance allows. Furthermore, drivers do not always need or want visually displayed information (e.g., an electronic map) to assist them in route navigation. In unfamiliar traffic networks, a motorist's propensity to change routes is strongly correlated to the quality of ATIS information being processed. With the right amount of traffic information presented using an effective conveyance method, more drivers are likely to accept and use ATIS information and divert to alternate routes. The challenge for ATIS designers is to provide options that are acceptable to ATIS users.

AB A comprehensive highway cost model can be used for optimizing highway alignments subject to a number of design constraints. Because a geographic information system (GIS) can spatially represent the locations of properties, floodplains, streams, and other geographical characteristics of significance in a highway cost model, it can provide valuable input to a highway design optimization model. Additionally, a GIS-based model can be developed to compute geographically sensitive costs to be used with an iterative optimization scheme. However, connecting a GIS to a highway optimization model requires full automation of an entire search process in which there is a continuous exchange of inputs and outputs until the optimized solution is obtained. An integrated model is developed by linking a GIS model with an optimization model employing genetic algorithms (GAs). The GIS model provides accurate geographical features, computes location-dependent costs, and transmits these costs to an external program. That program computes length-dependent costs and user costs and then, using GAs, optimizes the highway alignment to minimize the sum of all costs. An example study using real land use and environmental features is presented for a part of Talbot County, Maryland. The computational performance of the integrated model is assessed.

AB In this paper the stability of traffic equilibrium is analysed by using a framework where advanced traveller information systems (ATIS) are explicitly modelled. The role played by information in traffic networks is discussed, with particular reference to the day-to-day dynamics of the traffic network and to system stability at equilibrium. The perspective adopted is that of transportation planning under recurrent network conditions. The network is considered to be in equilibrium, viewed as a fixed-point state of a day-to-day deterministic process, here modelled as a time-discrete non-linear Markovian dynamic system. In discussing the effects generated by the introduction of ATIS, the paper examines: changes in the fixed point(s) with respect to the absence of ATIS, how the theoretical conditions for fixed-point existence and uniqueness are affected, and the impact on the stability properties and the stability region at equilibrium. Most of the analyses are carried out with explicit theoretical considerations. Moreover, a toy network is also employed to explore numerically the effects of removing some assumptions concerning the accuracy of ATIS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Washington State Ferries' (WSF) newest performance measures emanate from broader issues in transportation planning and a public mood toward less government. A multimodal transportation perspective and program accountability are now key concepts in management within Washington State government. The development of performance measures is guided by WSF's strategic plan, which sets out the mission, goals, and strategic initiatives of the organization. The process uses three techniques to maximize success-alignment (of goals, measures, and actions), feedback, and oversight Although the final set of performance measures leaves room for improvement, particularly with regard to output versus outcome, these measures represent significant change for WSF. Performance measurement makes WSF accountable to the ferry rider and the taxpayer. Implementation of performance measures soon leads to the issue of data support and information systems. The goal of measurement is decision support Without good data or a good information system that manages the data, the decision support function is nullified. The ferry system has had variable experience in information technology projects. Taking advantage of lessons learned and using a comprehensive, deliberate approach, WSF is proposing an information model that uses industry best practices and a user-driven system.

DE Vehicle emissions; Inter-vehicle safety warning system (ISWS);
   Microscopic traffic simulation; MOVES
AB Driver inattentiveness is one of critical factors contributing to vehicle crashes. The inter-vehicle safety warning information system (ISWS) is a technology to enhance driver attentiveness by providing warning messages about upcoming hazards using connected vehicle environments. A novel feature of the proposed ISWS is its ability to detect hazardous driving events, such as abrupt accelerations and lane changes, which are defined as moving hazards with a higher potential of causing crashes. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the ISWS in reducing vehicle emissions and its potential for traffic congestion mitigation. This study included a field experiment that documented actual vehicle maneuvering patterns for abrupt accelerations and lane changes, which were used for more realistic simulation evaluations, in addition to normal accelerations and lane changes. Probe vehicles equipped with customized on-board units consisting of a global positioning system (GPS) device, accelerometer, and gyro sensor were used to obtain the vehicle maneuvering data. A microscopic simulator, VISSIM, was used to simulate a driver's responsive behavior when warning messages were delivered. A motor vehicle emission simulator (MOVES) was then used to estimate vehicle emissions. The results show that reduction in vehicle emissions increased when the ISWS's market penetration rate (MPR) and the congestion level of the traffic conditions increased. The maximum CO and CO2 emission reductions achieved were approximately 6% and 7%, respectively, under LOS D traffic conditions. The outcomes of this study can be valuable for deriving smarter operational strategies for ISWS to account for environmental impacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Dynamics of commuting decision behaviour under advanced traveller

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper addresses departure time and route switching decisions made by commuters in response to Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS), It is based on the data collected from an experiment using a dynamic interactive travel simulator for laboratory studies of user responses under real-time information. The experiment involves actual commuters who simultaneously interact with each other within a simulated traffic corridor that consists of alternative travel facilities with differing characteristics. These commuters can determine their departure time and route at the origin and their path en-route at various decision nodes along their trip. A multinomial probit model framework is used to capture the serial correlation arising from repeated decisions made by the same respondent. The resulting behavioural model estimates support the notion that commuters' route switching decisions are predicated on the expectation of an improvement in trip time that exceeds a certain threshold (indifference band), which varies systematically with the remaining trip time to the destination, subject to a minimum absolute improvement (about 1 min).

TI Analysis of Awareness and Use of Traffic Information System with
   Revealed Preference Data Case Study of Klang Valley, Malaysia
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID VARIABLE MESSAGE SIGNS; DRIVERS ROUTE CHOICE; BEHAVIOR
AB To alleviate traffic congestion on Malaysia's highways and roads, the Integrated Transport Information System (ITIS) was established in Klang Valley, Malaysia, to collect and disseminate updated traffic information. One important aspect of this system is the use of various traffic information tools [Internet, radio, and variable message signs (VMS)] in disseminating traffic information pretrip and en route. To investigate the effectiveness of IT'S, this paper assesses the level of awareness and use of ITIS in the Klang Valley region. Using a revealed preference survey and adopting a discrete choice modeling approach, researchers found that the level of awareness (58% for VMS, 22% for radio pretrip, 48% for radio en route, and 12% for Internet) and use (29% change departure time and 22% divert) of ITIS were low in the region. Driver demographics had little impact on the awareness and use of ITIS, whereas trip characteristics played an important role. Drivers in the Klang Valley region had limited trust in the accuracy of data provided by ITIS and did not perceive such data to be useful in reducing their travel time. These findings demonstrate the need for strategies to improve awareness of ITIS and to increase its credibility.

AB This study estimates the effects of an advanced traveler general information system (ATGIS), which includes fuel consumption and health-related emissions cost information on transportation network users' travel choice behavior for recurrent congestion conditions. The effects are estimated using four different formulations based on four different behavioral assumptions. Incorporating stochastic features in link cost estimation rather than in route choice, we provide a novel modeling approach that enables us to use transportation planning models of major metropolitan areas without a need for major computationally-expensive changes in the existing models. We examined the effects of an ATGIS on the Fresno, CA, road network and found several interesting results. First, the ATGIS impact is closely related to pre-system (prior to the implementation of an ATGIS) perceived fuel and emissions costs. Total travel time in the city can be reduced by 17% (no pre-system perceived costs) to 1% (accurate pre-system perceived costs), and even increased by 1% (higher-than-actual pre-system perceived costs). Second, the addition of emissions costs, although negligible relative to fuel and time costs, can effectively reduce total system-wide travel time by up to 1% and fuel consumption by up to 0.6% during peak hours. Third, the ATGIS can reduce annual social costs by as much as $1053 million (high gas price, no pre-system perception) to $48 million (medium gas price, accurate pre-system perception), which are comparable to social cost savings by a congestion pricing (CP) scheme in the study area.

AB The New Hampshire Department of Transportation (NHDOT) first conducted a Rock Cut Hazard Survey in 1975, which included 182 rock cuts. The program has evolved since 1975 and now incorporates 380 rock cuts and 4 Rock Fall Hazard Rating Systems. Using New Hampshire's State Planning and Research funding, a research project was initiated with the objective of combining new rock cut data with preexisting data into a geographic information system (GIS). Rock cut point features were collected for every rock cut with the Global Positioning System and were added as a data layer on top of existing data coverage available through the department's GIS server. A relational database was developed that would store all rock cut data and would be linked to the GIS through a standard language query connect statement. A Brunton compass was used to collect rock cut structural data, and a digital camera was used to photograph every rock cut. The structural data were graphically represented in the GIS in the form of rose diagrams, stereonets, and density plots. A laser profiler was used to collect two-dimensional profiles on selected rock cuts so rock fall simulations could be conducted. The GIS does have limitations, including the network bandwidth, accessibility restrictions, and resource allocation for maintaining current and accurate data. Deployment of an Internet mapping service has been recommended to increase accessibility and to allow all NHDOT users access to the Rock Cut Management System through a web browser.

AB It is important to understand consumer response to potential Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) so that we may better design such services and build more accurate forecasts of their impacts. This study focuses on understanding the way in which consumers learn about ATIS and develop their perceptions and how these stages impact consumers' decisions to purchase ATIS. Without understanding both the "willingness to pay" aspect of consumer response, and the way in which consumers become knowledgeable about such products, it is difficult to understand or influence the impact that ATIS will have on the transportation system. In this paper, a new data collection procedure is presented that combines a market simulator (in which subjects can acquire product information about future ATIS) with a travel simulator (in which subjects can make automobile trips on the computer with the aid of the ATIS of their choice). The market simulator is a new tool that has been used with success in market research to study the penetration of new products. The ATIS simulator provides a flexible and relatively inexpensive method of obtaining data on all stages of consumer response to ATIS. Most importantly, the simulator allows the observation and modeling of the product information acquisition process. A conceptual model to predict purchase behavior is also presented. This model specifically addresses the role of the product information search and acquisition process and its impact on a consumer perception and purchase decision. Finally, data from a preliminary run of 10 subjects on a prototype version of the ATIS Market/Travel Simulator are presented and analyzed.

AB The availability of information and its form can exert an important influence over travel behavior. There are now an increasing number of systems available to provide information on road conditions to automobile drivers and truckers although in most cases there is still a strong reliance on radio information. Increasingly the issue is less one of developing a new technology to disseminate traffic information and more one of modifying institutions and behavior. In terms of behavior, there is still considerable inertia in terms of taking up modern information systems which may be rationalized in some cases because systems have been poor in the past, often giving late or inappropriate information. Institutionally, therefore, there is the issue of delivery. This study is concerned with looking at the potential for greater commercial involvement in providing traffic information particularly to leisure travelers. It looks at a case study in northern Virginia that explores the possible involvement of commercial radio in offering information on the Interstate-gl corridor. The analysis is based upon an interview survey of road users questioning them on the attributes they seek from information radio traffic information sources. The specific aim being to see if there exists sufficient interest in a combined entertainment/information channel to attract commercial interest. The overall conclusion is that while many travelers are regular users of the corridor they do supplement their experiences from information systems and that there is some scope for introducing combined entertainment/traffic information channels.

AB This case study involved the review of the advanced traveler information system (ATIS) and advanced traffic management system (ATMS) and the use of the information backbone ((IB)-B-2) component of the intelligent transportation system of the Seattle Metropolitan Model Deployment Initiative. Through a survey of documents and other material combined with interviews of key participants, the nature of any increased benefits or reduced costs associated with ATIS and ATMS integration resulting from the (IB)-B-2 was examined. The results suggest that the distributed nature of the (IB)-B-2 provided for the coordination of responsibility among multiple information contributors and processors as well as geographic flexibility. The open nature of participation was also cited as a factor in making connection to the (IB)-B-2 a relatively easy matter since software tools for interfacing are provided. For contributors, the (IB)-B-2 has provided the ability to distribute information via a single access method, thereby reducing support effort. Processors can gain easier access to existing information in addition to being able to develop composite information from multiple sources. Comparison of costs between the (IB)-B-2 and alternative information system designs was difficult because of the differences in functionality provided. However, it appears likely that costs are shifted from the information contributors to the processors, who gain from the addition and realization of value in the marketplace.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are advantageous in their high maneuverability for long-range outdoor target tracking. In this paper, we develop a UAV-based target tracking and recognition system using an intelligent gimbal system with the capabilities of accurate camera positioning, fast image processing, and multi-modality information fusion. Algorithms of consensus-based target tracking, moving background processing, and neural network-based target detection/recognition are optimized for embedded implementation. A geographic information system (GIS) is utilized to provide geo-location, environmental, and contextual information. The experimental results demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed UAV-based target tracking and recognition framework.

ID HOUSEHOLD
AB This paper presents a statistical analysis of commuters' route choice including the effect of traffic information. The paper utilizes data collected from two stated preference survey techniques. Two route choice models were estimated. The first model used five hypothetical binary choice sets collected in a computer-aided telephone interview. The objective of the model was to determine how travel time variation affects route choice, and the potential interplay among travel time variation, traffic information acquisition and route choice. The second model used data collected in a mail survey from three binary route choice stated preference scenarios customized according to each respondent's actual commute route and travel time. The objective of the model was to investigate the potential effect of advanced traveler information systems on route choice. The correlation among error components in repeated measurement data was addressed in this paper with individual-specific random error components in a binary legit model with normal mixing distribution. The results underscored the significance of traffic information and the potential effect of advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) on route choice. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID SYSTEMS; IMPACTS; MODEL
AB Travelers can often benefit from acquiring relevant information on their intended modes and routes. By providing pretrip and en route information, advanced traveler information systems present real opportunities for improving the travel experience of individuals and increasing efficiency of the transportation system. In this regard, it is important to understand how consumers acquire and respond to travel information. This study develops a conceptual framework identifying important factors influencing travelers' information acquisition behavior and their response to dynamic information. The model is empirically tested with the use of a recent and comprehensive regional travel survey. A sample selection model is estimated to be consistent with the two-stage processing or travel information (i.e., acquisition and response). Results show that information acquisition and changes in travel plans are sensitive to different sets of factors. In the data set analyzed, normal travel time to work is found to be a critical factor in information acquisition, but has an insignificant association with the change of travel plans. Furthermore, travelers respond differently to various information technologies. In an examination of change behavior (including route change, mode change, and trip cancellation), Internet access had the strongest association with change. With examination of specific route change behavior, transportation information obtained through radio had the strongest association with change. The study generates useful implications on how to improve existing and future traveler information systems.

AB Inclement weather acutely affects road surface and driving conditions and can negatively impact traffic mobility and safety. Highway authorities have long been using road weather information systems (RWISs) to mitigate the risk of adverse weather on traffic. The data gathered, processed, and disseminated by such systems can improve both the safety of the traveling public as well as the effectiveness of winter road maintenance operations. As the road authorities continue to invest in expanding their existing RWIS networks, there is a growing need to determine the optimal deployment strategies for RWISs. To meet such demand, this study presents an innovative geostatistical approach to quantitatively analyze the spatiotemporal variations of the road weather and surface conditions. With help of constructed semivariograms, this study quantifies and examines both the spatial and temporal coverage of RWIS data. A case study of Alberta, which is one of the leaders in Canada in the use of RWISs, was conducted to indicate the reliability and applicability of the method proposed herein. The findings of this research offer insight for constructing a detailed spatiotemporal RWIS database to manage and deploy different types of RWISs, optimize winter road maintenance resources, and provide timely information on inclement road weather conditions for the traveling public.

AB This paper proposes a model to calculate the average speed of transmission of intervehicle communication (IVC) messages in a general traffic stream on highways in the early stage of deploying distributed traffic information systems (DTIS). The model helps explain the relationship between average IVC message speed and traffic parameters such as equipped vehicle density, traffic flow speed, and traffic direction. Simulation results are used to verify the correctness of the model. This model needs a much shorter calculation time than a simulation. Moreover, the theoretical analysis helps provide more insightful explanations of the phenomenon for IVC performance analysis. The results of this paper would help people better understand the design criteria for DTIS.

AB The effects of advanced traveler information system (ATIS) accuracy and the extent of ATIS roadway instrumentation on the on-time reliability benefits to routine users of ATISs were evaluated by using archived estimates of roadway travel times to re-create hypothetical, retrospective paired driving trials between travelers with and without ATISs. Previous research using this technique demonstrated that travelers who received notification of congestion before departure could realize time management benefits from improved on-time reliability and trip predictability. On the basis of millions of hypothetical trips over a 12-month period in Los Angeles, California, it was found that a net benefit to an average user of ATIS existed if the error in travel time estimation was in the range of 14% to 21% or better, a threshold that depended on regional day-to-day travel time variability. For less accurate ATIS services, only certain subsets of the driving population, such as those with relatively long or highly variable trips, may realize any benefit. Furthermore, it was observed that a nearly optimal geographical deployment of ATIS could garner as much as 56% of the benefit of full coverage from the first 30% of deployment. Yet, the best deployment strategy is not as simple as prioritizing links on the basis of day-to-day variability. In making cost-effective trade-off decisions about how to invest in improved ATISs, be it expanding geographic coverage or improving accuracy, the findings underscore the importance of understanding the accuracy required to generate ATIS user benefits on the basis of regional day-to-day roadway variability.

AB This paper examines whether the psychological effects of real-time transit information on commuters will lead to a gain in transit ridership. A conceptual model, which posits a simultaneous structure among psychological and behavioral constructs, was developed on the basis of cognitive models of behavior. Path analysis was used to analyze such a process. A detailed stated preference survey for Chicago commuters composed the data-gathering approach. The analysis results showed that real-time transit information systems might achieve the goal of increasing transit ridership through their psychological effects on commuters. The results indicated that the provision of real-time transit information might serve as an intervention to break current transit nonusers' travel habits and in consequence increase the mode share of transit use. Moreover, the results of this study suggest that real-time transit information may be more successful in increasing transit ridership if combined with facilitating programs that enhance commuters' opportunities to be exposed to such systems before using them.

TI Estimation of Short-Term Bus Travel Time by Using Low-Resolution
   Automated Vehicle Location Data

ID ARRIVAL-TIME; PREDICTION
AB Estimation of short-term bus travel time is an essential component of effective intelligent transportation systems (ITS), including traveler information systems and transit signal priority (TSP) strategies. Several technologies, such as automated vehicle location (AVL) systems, can provide real-time information for estimation of bus travel time. However, low resolution of data from such technologies presents a challenge to accurate estimation of travel time. Several models for estimation of bus travel time at signalized urban arterials were developed and tested. These models used low-frequency AVL data and required only knowledge of network specifications such as locations of bus stops and intersections. First, a linear regression model was developed; it decomposed total travel time into its components, including running travel time, dwell time at bus stops, and delay at signalized intersections. Second, various machine learning models, including support vector regression (SVR) with nonlinear kernel, ridge, Lasso, decision tree, and Bayesian ridge were trained by using Python libraries such as scikit-learn and evaluated. A segment of Washington Street in Boston, Massachusetts, was selected as the study site. The results indicate that the SVR model outperformed other regression models in generalized error measures, in particular those of mean absolute error and root mean square error. The findings of this study can lead to improved traveler information systems and more-efficient TSP strategies and, overall, can contribute to better transit quality of service.

AB Traffic accidents are one of the important problems in our country as it in the world. The World Health Organization case reports published in 2015 stated that approximately 1.25 million people died each year and more than 50 million people injured as a result of traffic accidents in the world. Considering this situation, it is seen that traffic accidents are mostly human originated and one of the major problems that is negatively affecting life. In this context, many investments and many studies have been performed on the determination of traffic accident black spots to reduce traffic accidents.
   The current study aimed to get a descriptive model for determining the traffic accident black spots using model-based spatial statistical methods. These methods are Poisson regression, Negative Binomial regression and Empirical Bayesian method. The ultimate goal of this study was to build a model that allowed evaluating all the methods together in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) which is quite widely used nowadays.
   In the present study, the data were obtained from 300 thousand traffic accidents occurred on 2408 different state roads during the years from 2005 to 2013 from the General Directorate of Highways. The state roads of Turkey were divided into 32,107 sub-segments with the length of 1 km. Based on the study results, 126 sub-segments were determined as traffic accident black spots depending on the method used. According to comparison of the methods used in the present study, the Empirical Bayesian method provided the best results in terms of accuracy and consistency. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study presents an innovative approach to the planning of a critical highway sensor infrastructure - road weather information system (RWIS). The problem is formulated to minimize the spatially averaged kriging variance of hazardous road surface conditions while maximizing the coverage of accident-prone areas. This optimization framework takes explicit account of the value of information from an RWIS network, providing the potential to enhance the overall efficacy of winter maintenance operations and the safety of the travelers. Spatial simulated annealing is used to solve the resulting optimization problem and its performance is demonstrated using a real-world case study from Minnesota, United States. The case study illustrates the distinct features of the proposed model, assesses the effectiveness of the current location setting, and recommends additional stations locations. The findings of our study suggest that the proposed model could become a valuable decision-support tool for planning a new RWIS network and evaluating the performance of alternative RWIS expansion plans.

AB Streamlining the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and FHWA's transportation planning process is a goal of all state departments of transportation as well as a presidential goal and directive (Executive Order 13274, Environmental Stewardship and Transportation Infrastructure Project Reviews). One section of the nationally designated Interstate 69 (I-69) corridor, the proposed north-south interstate from Canada to Mexico, used a project study process that combined innovative geographic information system (GIS) technology with early, proactive coordination with state and federal resource agencies, Native American tribes, and the public to expedite the NEPA project development process. The Southeast Arkansas I-69 Connector Project (I-69 connector) successfully integrated the development and management of a project-specific GIS with early and continuous stakeholder outreach. This approach fostered a cooperative project atmosphere in which alternatives were developed that responded to the concerns of all stakeholders. This approach proved invaluable in consensus building and in achieving concurrence in a compressed time frame from the public and regulatory resource agencies on the ultimate location of the new facility.

ID LONGITUDINAL DATA; DECISIONS; BEHAVIOR
AB Correlated multinomial route choice data were modeled under an advanced traveler information system (ATIS). A travel simulator was used as a dynamic data collection tool. The simulator uses realistic network and real historical traffic volumes. It provides five levels of ATIS and accounts for types of delay. A 25-node and 40-link network was used. Sixty-three qualified subjects performed a total of 539 trial days. Forty-four distinct routes were chosen. The multinomial generalized estimating equation (MGEE) methodology was used with a generalized polytomous function and an exchangeable correlation structure. MGEEs account for the serial correlation between repeated choices made by the same subject as well as the correlation due to the overlapping between alternatives. The modeling results show that drivers can identify and follow the shortest path when they are provided with advice-free traffic information on all the network links. In addition, it is shown that the odds of choosing a certain shortest-path route, whether the drivers are advised or not, vary from route to route, depending on the characteristics of the route itself. It was proved that the proposed model could account for a correlation in the multinomial repeated route choices with simple computational effort, even for a large number of alternatives.

AB The primary goal of naturalistic driving studies is to provide a comprehensive observation of the driver's behaviour under real-life conditions by measureing a great number of parameters at high temporal frequencies. Achieving this goal, however, is a complex endeavor that faces many challenges such as the complexity of the vehicle instrumentation during the phase of data collection, and the difficult handling of large data volumes during the phase of data analysis. These drawbacks often cause episodes of data losses. Improving the technical aspects of the collection of naturalistic data is of paramount importance to increase the return of the investment made in it. An aspect to consider is the control of the quality of data obtained. The procedures commonly applied often present a high workload and low levels of reliability in the results. For this reason, new and more efficient procedures should be implemented. This study proposes an innovative methodology for the quality control of these data through geographic information systems (GIS), which permit a fast, efficient and effective data evaluation. Relative and absolute errors can be located through cartographic representation obtained with GIS. Some graphical examples about the detection of the errors are shown.

AB Weather has a significant impact on winter traffic, directly by causing poor visibility or indirectly by causing poor driving conditions (e.g., slipperiness due to snow, slush, or ice on the road), multiplying the risk of an accident. To decrease accident risk and to improve safety and traffic flow, the Finnish National Road Administration has developed a road weather information system (RWIS), the purpose of which is to provide the road maintenance staff with information about prevailing road and weather conditions on the road network in winter. With the help of this system, road maintenance measures such as salting and plowing can be timed better, and the amount of antislipping agents used can be optimized to a minimum level. Another growing function of the system is to provide information to road users. The system's operation is based on automated road weather stations equipped with measuring devices. Approximately 270 road weather stations located along the main roads throughout the entire country are currently connected to the system. These stations collect data about air, road surface, and dew point temperatures; wind; humidity; rain; visibility; and surface road conditions. The RWIS retrieves data from the road weather stations every 15 to 60 min. An road weather data are centrally stored in a common, national database. The current status of the Finnish RWIS is described, and plans for the future are discussed.

AB Highway planning involves selection of a cost-effective corridor in an environmentally responsible manner. With the recent advances in geographic information systems (GISs), most environmental, real estate, and design databases and maps are available in the form of GIS layers. Several mathematical optimization algorithms have been developed to optimize highway alignments, among which genetic algorithms appear most promising because of their ability to avoid getting trapped in local optima. In recent studies, a GIS was integrated with genetic algorithms, enabling full exploitation of GIS features in highway alignment optimization. Those optimization models still lack some dynamic decision-making capabilities during optimal search, such as consideration of bridge cost when rivers are encountered and intersection and interchange costs when roads are encountered. A study that used a GIS as a dynamic decision-making tool in performing highway optimization is presented. Algorithms are developed to estimate costs associated with bridges, tunnels, intersections, and overpasses. A fully automated model is developed that allows dynamic data exchange between the GIS and the optimization algorithm. An example that uses real geographic information from Maryland is presented. The results indicate that consideration of bridges and intersections is significant in highway alignment optimization.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES

AB The fragmented and ever more specialized nature of today's railway systems makes it more and more complex to operate. An increasing number of actors are involved in the operation of a railway service. Infrastructure management is being separated from the operational aspect. Apart from the traditional state-owned train operators, open access and private operators start using the same infrastructure as well. Additionally, an increasing number of information systems, such as for real-time passenger information and entertainment need to exchange information. Therefore, Information & Communication Technologies have an increasingly vital role to play in the operation of the railways. However, as the use of stand-alone information systems improves the efficient operation of a single railway stakeholder, due to the complex fragmented nature, there is a clear need to integrate and correlate the available information. A high level of structured interoperability between information systems is required to correctly combine and manage this complex information. Several mechanisms exist to integrate information systems. The approach presented in this paper discusses the integration on data level. The main benefit of this approach is that it supports independent application development. It is after all undesirable and nearly impossible to centralise application development in world-wide fragmented and large systems, such as the railways. We will discuss a number of approaches towards data integration. Two main technologies are considered, namely Unified Modelling Language (UML) and ontologies. An ontology-based solution is compared with an UML-based approach. The advantages and disadvantages of both UML and ontology-based approaches are presented. The results are evaluated by means of a demonstrator developed as part of the InteGRail project (Intelligent Integration of Railway Systems), an FP6 EU research project. We believe that this demonstrator, the Network Statement Checker, is an ideal candidate to demonstrate the advantages of an ontology-based integrated information system. This tool allows the infrastructure operators to combine the network statements of different countries in different formats and to analyse them in a transparent way. The ontology-based approach shows clear advantages compared to the UML approach, by means of the formally defined model, but on the other hand the performance of the currently available tools is still to be improved. However, we believe that the augmented value of an ontology-based approach is also to be found in lower development costs because of its potential reuse in multiple applications, since their philosophy is to serve as a domain model instead of as a data model for a specific application.

TI Use of Pavement Management Information System for Verification of
   Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide Performance Predictions
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The performance models used in the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) are nationally calibrated with design inputs and performance data obtained primarily from the national Long-Term Pavement Performance database. It is necessary to verify and calibrate MEPDG performance models for local highway agencies' implementation by taking into account local materials, traffic information, and environmental conditions. This paper discusses the existing pavement management information system (PMIS) with respect to the MEPDG and the accuracy of the nationally calibrated MEPDG prediction models for Iowa highway conditions. All the available PMIS data for Interstate and primary road systems in Iowa were retrieved from the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) PMIS. The retrieved databases were then compared and evaluated with respect to the input requirements and outputs for Version 1.0 of the MEPDG software. Using Iowa DOT's comprehensive PMIS database, researchers selected 16 types of pavement sections across Iowa (not used for national calibration in the NCHRP 1-37A study). A database of MEPDG inputs and the actual pavement performance measures for the selected pavement sites were prepared for verification. The accuracy of the MEPDG performance models for Iowa conditions was statistically evaluated. The verification testing showed promising results in terms of MEPDG's performance prediction accuracy for Iowa conditions. Recalibrating the MEPDG performance models for Iowa conditions is recommended to improve the accuracy of pavement performance predictions.

ID PUBLIC-TRANSIT; LAND-USE; EMPLOYMENT; AREA
AB A new method has been developed to measure directly changes in transit accessibility-the combined spatial effect of shifts in land use patterns and transit service-between metropolitan jobs and census tracts with high proportions of the people who most depend on good transit. Through focused analysis of transit routes serving one neighborhood in Buffalo and one neighborhood in Rochester, New York, two main questions are addressed. First, did transit-dependent poor people who lived in inner-city neighborhoods lose capacity to access jobs by transit during the 1990s? Second, if so, how much of the reduction in accessibility was due to changes in transit service rather than to dispersion of land use? Steps include formulating a gravity model using geographic information systems (GISs), calculating an accessibility index at two times during the 1990s at the census tract level, and disaggregating the accessibility change into subcomponents of change in land use and change in transit service by holding relevant variables constant to a base year. Findings do not support the a priori expectations: the transit component of change does not appear to contribute to a loss in accessibility from high-poverty neighborhoods. The model provides insights into the causes of accessibility change, the geographic distribution of accessibility change, and better assessments of whether transit agencies are successfully adapting to changes in land use.

AB This study demonstrates the sequential linking of two types of models to permit the comprehensive evaluation of regional transportation and land use policies. First, we operate an integrated urban model (TRANUS), which represents both land and travel markets with zones and networks, The travel and land use projections from TRANUS are outlined, to demonstrate the general reasonableness of the results, as this is the first application of a market-based urban model in the US. Second, the land use projections for each of the 58 zones in the urban model were fed into a Geographic information System (GIS)-based land allocation model, which spatially allocates the several land uses within each zone according to simple accessibility rules. While neither model is new, this is one of the first attempts to link these two types of models for regional policy assessments. Other integrated urban models may be linked to other GIS land allocation models in this fashion. Pairing these two types of models allows the user to gain the advantages of the urban models, which represent spatial competition across a region and produce measures of user welfare (traveler and locator surplus), and the advantages of the GIS land allocation models, which produce detailed land use maps that can then be used for environmental impact assessment.

AB Since advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) have been introduced, their potential benefits as well as their drawbacks have been discussed controversially. This will continue as long as the drivers' reactions upon current or even predictive information about the traffic situation are not known. Thus, traffic models that also consider this feedback are necessary. In this paper, we address a basic two-route scenario with different types of information and study the impact of it using simulations. The road users are modeled as agents, a natural and promising approach to describe them. Different ways of generating current information are tested. It is pointed out that the nature of the information very much influences the potential benefits of the ATIS. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Application of Road Visibility Information System to Winter Maintenance
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
AB A road visibility information system (RVIS) was developed that uses images transmitted by multiple closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras as road visibility information. Feasibility studies in the daytime during the winters of 2005 to 2006 and 2006 to 2007 were performed on national routes 230 and 231. During those two winters, the RVIS calculated visibility scale and road visibility index (RVI) automatically, accurately, continuously, and in a timely manner from road images recorded by multiple CCTV cameras. The RVIS processed 90% of the images transmitted by 14 CCTV cameras. The RVIS provided areawide visibility information in many formats and through many kinds of media and devices. On the basis of stored road visibility data, the finding was a high correspondence between the RVI and the subjective visibility evaluation for the same road images. In addition, this study demonstrates that the RVI monitoring website and e-mail alerts can speedily and reliably inform road administrators of snowstorm-induced poor visibility. The RVIS has the potential to collect data on road visibility reliably during daytime using images transmitted by multiple CCTV cameras. However, it is necessary to improve data collection at night and to capture still images accurately and quickly.

AB Efficiency is essential to Internet transit trip-planning systems. High-quality data models of transit networks hold the key to efficiency of data querying and network analysis. Because of the schedule control and dynamic nature of the transit network, highway-based generic network models cannot be directly implemented by transit systems. In the process of developing an Internet transit trip-planning system, an object-oriented geographic information system data model, which handles the dynamic nature of transit systems, was developed. In this data model, the entire transit network and its components are modeled as space-time entities (objects) that have start times, end times, and spans of lifetime. A time map object controls the creation and destruction of these objects. Therefore, in the process of network search, only active components of the system (i.e., with transit services available) are built into the network topology. This has greatly reduced data redundancy and enhanced network search efficiency. The data model showed good performance when it was implemented in an online trip-planning service for Waukesha Metro Transit, Wisconsin.

AB With numerous adaptive signal strategies to choose from and the ever-increasing cost of deploying new technologies, transportation professionals need to carefully determine the optimal locations of specific adaptive signal control strategies to maximize their benefits. An interoperable decision support system that not only recommends the best network location for deployment but also provides a seamless data exchange between various data sources will be extremely helpful. The development of a prototype geographic information system-(GIS-) based decision support system (DSS) to address some of these issues is presented. A novel software bridge is implemented to ensure data exchange between the most widely used traffic signal optimization and analysis software, Synchro and the developed G IS-based prototype, the Rutgers Adaptive Signal Control Selection (RASCS) DSS. Integrated modules of this unique GIS-based DSS tool-a macroscopic simulator, a rule-based expert system built up by using various sources, and a benefit-cost analysis module-are then described in detail. Case studies that make use of the developed tool also are presented.

AB In this paper, we present a modeling approach, based on Fuzzy Data Fusion, to reproduce drivers' dynamic choice behavior under an Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS). The proposed model uses the Possibility Theory to model Uncertainty embedded in human perception of information. We have introduced a time-dependent Possibility Distribution of Information to model the users' changing perception of travel time also based on current network conditions.. Drivers' choice models are often developed and calibrated by using Stated Preference (SP) surveys, amongst others. In this work, we present an experiment to set up an SP-tool based on a driving simulator developed at the Polytechnic University of Bari. The results obtained by the proposed model are analyzed and compared with the driver dynamic behavior observed in the experiment.

AB In maritime traffic, a route is one or more known tracks along which navigation takes place or there is intention to sail. Meteorological factors are important if the route exceeds the distance of 1500M [1]. Meteorological navigation is the selection of a navigational route in view of meteorological factors and control of vessel during heavy weather conditions and safe navigation aimed at the protection of human lives, vessels and cargo during heavy weather. The paper proposes a model of grouping and evaluating estimates of meteorological factors when planning meteorological navigation. It is advised to upgrade the Electronic Chart Display and Information System - ECDIS program with the aim of allowing for the computer planning of meteorological navigation.

AB wConventional approaches to solve slope failure problems involve deterministic and probabilistic models to calculate the factor of safety for slopes. These models usually require a large amount of field and laboratory data on soil properties and slope geometry. This requirement makes the determination of conventional factors of safety highly unrealistic if required over large areas, unless some techniques are used to direct investigative efforts to those areas with higher potential for failure. An efficient screening methodology involves creating a hazard zonation map in which regions are classified according to varying instability potential. A database of slope failure details and the power of a geographic information system (GIS) were used to analyze digital data for various causative factors of slope instability to assess the reliability of current landslide prediction methods in northwest Arkansas. A hazard zonation model was created through statistical weighting techniques from remotely sensed imagery, publicly available spatial data, and slope failure data. All of this information was visualized and analyzed by using a GIS. The model's general applicability was tested on another area with similar geoenvironmental conditions with good results.

TI Introducing the Pedestrian Accessibility Tool Walkability Analysis for a

ID WALKING
AB The indexes for walkability proposed so far refer generally to the closest amenities and public transport stops and the existing network structure. The weights of the attributes do not reflect the independently measured preferences of the users and residents. Design attributes such as the location and type of crossings and walkway design features are usually surveyed in walkability audits. However, such attributes are usually not considered when pedestrian walksheds or other accessibility-based walkability indexes are calculated. Nevertheless, these design attributes are very relevant for actual planning decisions. The proposed walkability index can be behaviorally calibrated, has been implemented as a geographic information system tool, and is published as open source software. The pedestrian accessibility tool allows the evaluation of existing and future urban plans with regards to walkability. The tool calculates Hansen-based accessibility indicators with the use of a customizable specification of the generalized walking costs, and it incorporates user-defined weights of destination attractiveness. The basic user workflow of the tool is summarized. Three case studies show real-world applications of the tool to support the planning of pedestrian infrastructure in an urban context. With indications of potential areas of improvement that have been reported by pilot users working in an urban planning department, hints are also given for future research.

AB The intelligent transport systems (ITS) deployment begins with implementation of traffic control signals and traffic management on a road network. The next stage is the provision of traffic information to drivers. The third stage is the decision and operation assistance to drivers for safe driving. It will take time to reach the final stage of a fully automated driving because of the difficulties of getting social acceptance. Another final figure of ITS is that all transportation modes are integrated and provide continuous transportation service to users from door to door. Mobile information terminals such as cellular phones and motor vehicles will function as well as ordinary offices and homes. Then the ITS as an information system will be integrated into a general social information system. (C) 2002 Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan, Inc. and Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Knowledge of surface and subsurface geology and geotechnical properties is fundamental to planning, developing, and modernizing transportation systems. Through dynamic coupling of readily available areal geographic information system coverages and subsurface borehole data stored in a relational database, a spatially referenced digital catalog of borehole data was created for two pilot areas in Rhode Island. The borehole database was populated with data derived from Rhode Island Department of Transportation geotechnical reports and supplemental data from the U.S. Geological Survey groundwater site inventory system and local storm water and sewer projects. Most of these data were previously maintained in paper format, making historical or interproject data comparisons virtually impossible. Unification of these data in a single relational database yields two primary benefits: (a) historical data are readily accessible for review and therefore can be incorporated easily into the planning stages of new projects and (b) sophisticated analysis of the region becomes possible with access to data from multiple projects with both spatial and temporal coverage. Geologic data include bedrock geology, surface outcrops, unconsolidated materials, soil type, topographic and orthophotographic base maps, and location of boreholes and wells. Subsurface data include land surface elevation, depth to water table, depth to bedrock, presence of fill, high and low blow-count zones, and organic sediment. The digital catalog is distributed on a CD-ROM that includes ArcView project files and an Access relational database. The borehole data are also accessible through the Internet, with retrieval access for all users and data entry privileges for registered users.

ID WORK ZONES; CAPACITY
AB This paper describes the development of the Rutgers Interactive Lane Closure Application (RILCA), an interactive computer tool to plan lane closures for work zones. This tool provides traffic engineers with a computerized and easy-to-use lane closure application, along with other useful features. RILCA was developed with the Arc View geographic information system (GIS) software package as the main development environment. Arc View displays the interactive GIS map of the New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway, and other major freeways in New Jersey and its surrounding network. RILCA provides various analysis and visualization options to plan lane closures interactively, obtain traffic volume information, and conduct accident queries. RILCA was tested successfully, and New Jersey Department of Transportation (DOT) and New Jersey Turnpike Authority engineers now use it with all of the features presented in this paper. RILCA received an annual implementation award from the New Jersey DOT in 2009. The award recognized RILCA's usefulness and potential to improve the efficiency of traffic operations as a practical decision-support tool for lane closure decisions.

AB There is a growing need for automated procedures that can update road databases in Geospatial Information Systems (GIS). Such procedures are in a great demand when the GIS database needs to be updated very frequently and should comprise automated means for extracting road data from satellite images and updating GIS databases using the collected data. In this paper, the requirements for developing an automated procedure which (1) extracts road data from high-resolution satellite images and (2) prepares the extracted data for use in GIS is presented. The procedure includes a region growing algorithm to obtain road features, an edge detection algorithm, an image enhancement algorithm, a vectorization algorithm, and a georeferencing algorithm. The edge detection, image enhancement and vectorization algorithms are tested using three different high-resolution satellite images and the results are presented. Their performance is measured and analyzed individually.

TI Safety Impacts of Intervehicle Warning Information Systems for Moving
   Hazards in Connected Vehicle Environments
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Driver inattentiveness is one of the critical factors that contribute to vehicle crashes. The intervehicle safety warning information system (ISWS) is a technology to enhance driver attentiveness by providing warning messages about upcoming hazards under the connected vehicle environments. A novel feature of the proposed ISWS is its capability to detect hazardous driving events, which are defined as moving hazards with a high potential to cause crashes. The study presented in this paper evaluated the potential effectiveness of the ISWS to reduce crashes and to mitigate traffic congestion. The study included a field experiment that documented actual vehicle maneuvering patterns of accelerations and lane changes, which were used to enhance the realism of simulation evaluations. Probe vehicles equipped with customized onboard units, which consisted of a GPS device, accelerometer, and gyro sensor, were used. A microscopic simulator, VISSIM, was used to simulate a driver's responsive behavior after warning messages were delivered. A surrogate safety assessment model was used to derive surrogate safety measures to evaluate the effectiveness of ISWS in terms of traffic safety. The results showed a reduced number of rear-end conflicts when the ISWS's market penetration rate (MPR) and the congestion level of the traffic conditions increased. The reduced number of rear-end conflicts was approximately 84.3%, with a 100% MPR under Level of Service D traffic conditions. Analysis of the standard deviation of speed showed that a reduction of 39.9% was achieved. The outcomes of this study could be valuable to derive smarter operational strategies for ISWS.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article
AB A number of studies have evaluated the services provided by Advanced Traveler Information Systems [ATIS] under the assumption that information supplied to drivers would be, in some sense, perfect. However, lack of sufficiently useful data and system design constraints can lead to information that is less than useful to the ATIS user. This paper examines the effects of such imperfection through a simulation-based model that was applied over a part of a large metropolitan area. The model has four basic components: (i) an ATIS structure (that specifies the information-gathering, processing and disseminating aspects of the system) (ii) traveler behavior (iii) network characteristics and (iv) vehicle movement logic. Using a 'yoked driver' concept, a number of different route guidance strategies are examined. The results indicate that some strategies that would appear to be desirable are not so. Conversely, under high-congestion situations, strategies can be constructed that come close to 'rectifying' completely the effects of information imperfection. Overall the paper reiterates the potential of ATIS if information-giving strategies are designed carefully. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB Results from a survey of international bus rapid transit (BRT) systems reveal a wide range of technology options for implementing a BRT system. Eight BRT systems (seven existing and one under development) in North and South America demonstrate innovative applications of five bus technology components-vehicles, guideways and stations, control systems (dispatching and signaling), fare systems, and passenger information systems. These innovative applications, combined with fundamental changes in operating plans and the customer interface, provide a mode distinct from conventional bus transit. This preliminary phase of the survey found that guideway improvements are the most common strategy to move from conventional to rapid transit service. Innovations in vehicle design, control system technology, and fare system technology are also commonly used. All the surveyed systems demonstrate isolated innovation in passenger information systems technology. These technology applications were primarily directed toward improving the speed, reliability, and user-friendliness of service.

TI Geographic Information System Framework for Stormwater Drainage Asset
   Management
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Stormwater drainage systems (open channels, culverts, conduits, pump stations, etc.) are managed by municipalities,, utilities, and departments of transportation (DOTs) to collect rainfall, control storm peak flow, and reduce the risk of flooding during extreme storm events. Effective management of drainage systems is especially critical in the era of climate change and rapid urbanization, when more frequent and more intense than normal floods are expected to occur. Asset management offers an alternative to the crisis management approach to dealing with drainage infrastructure failures in the aftermath of floods. This paper addresses key data issues in stormwater drainage asset management, including defining inventory data requirements, developing practical condition assessment methods that consider both hydraulic capacity and physical conditions of drainage assets, and integrating inventory and condition data and documents in a geographic information. system (GIS) framework. The developed GIS framework was applied to the stormwater drainage system in El Paso, Texas. In the short term, this framework can help municipalities, utilities, and DOTs to focus on data that are sufficiently detailed to be useful for asset management but not so demanding of time and resources as to be unaffordable to collect and maintain. The long-term benefits, yet to be proved through testing and implementation, are more cost-effective strategies for preserving and improving drainage systems and for reducing the risk of costly flooding.

TI Parking difficulty and parking information system technologies and costs
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Before the implementation of a parking information system, it is necessary to evaluate the parking difficulty, technology choice, and system costs. In this study, the parking problem was quantified by asking parkers to express their parking difficulties in five scaled levels from the least to the most difficult. An ordered Probit model was developed to identify the factors that influence a parker to feel the parking difficulty. The results indicate that the amount of parking information parkers had before their trips was directly related to their parking search time, which in turn, influenced their perceptions of parking difficulty. Parkers' preferences to parking information technologies were identified based on developing binary and multinomial probit models. The results indicate that personal business trips and older persons would like to use the kiosk, while the more educated and males would not. Trips with shopping and social/recreation purposes and the drivers who had visited the destination areas frequently would like to choose roadside display. Drivers who had planned their parking and had Internet access would use in-vehicle device. The system cost was estimated based on the cost for each component of the system. The results show that providing en-route parking search information through roadside displays is more expensive than providing pre-trip information through a web site.

AB This paper describes a study into the effects of pre-trip information on travel behaviour, carried out as part of the DRIVE project EURONETT. The aim of the study was to investigate travellers' requirements for different types of travel information and methods of enquiry and to relate the process of information acquisition to changes in travel behaviour. The study was carried out using a stated preference approach, built on the use of a microcomputer based simulation of an in-home pre-trip information system offering information on travel times from home to City Centre, by bus and car, at different times of the day. A novel feature of the stated preference exercise was that respondents effectively generated their own choice set of alternatives through the process of information acquisition. Surveys were undertaken in parallel in Birmingham and Athens, thus allowing a comparison to be made between behaviour in typical Southern and Northern European settings.
   The first part of the paper discusses some of the fundamental behavioural and modelling issues raised by the introduction of advanced traveller information systems. It then describes the study methodology and the stated preference experiment. Results are presented from an analysis of the information acquisition process itself and from choice models relating the acquired information to effects on different dimensions of travel behaviour.

AB Real-time section-wide lane traffic variables such as density and lane-changing are vital to traffic control and management in urban areas. They can be used as decision variables to determine traffic control and management strategies in real time as well as characterize road traffic congestion for further use in advanced traveler information systems. Therefore, developing techniques which provide real-time information regarding section-wide inter-lane and intra-lane traffic variables is an increasingly important task in the area of advanced transportation management and information systems. This paper presents a stochastic system modeling approach to extracting real-time information of section-wide inter-lane as well as intra-lane traffic (e.g. lane-changing fractions, lane densities, etc.) utilizing lane traffic counts detected from point detectors. The proposed methodology consists of three principle elements: (1) specification of system states, (2) system modeling, and (3) recursive estimation. Preliminary test results indicated that the proposed methodology is promising for estimating real-time section-wide inter-lane as well as intra-lane traffic variables based merely on point detector data. The inter-lane and intra-lane traffic information generated by the proposed method can be further used in developing related technologies such as road traffic congestion detection, automatic incident detection, prediction of driver route choices, variable message signs and in-car navigation devices.

AB A dynamic travel-time prediction model was developed for the South Jersey (southern New Jersey) motorist real-time information system. During development and evaluation of the model, the integration of traffic flow theory, measurement and application of collected data, and traffic simulation were considered. Reliable prediction results can be generated with limited historical real-time traffic data. In the study, acoustic sensors were installed at potential congested places to monitor traffic congestion. A developed simulation model was calibrated with the data collected from the sensors, and this was applied to emulate traffic operations and evaluate the proposed prediction model under time-varying traffic conditions. With emulated real-time information (travel times) generated by the simulation model, an algorithm based on Kalman filtering was developed and applied to forecast travel times for specific origin-destination pairs over different periods. Prediction accuracy was evaluated by the simulation model. Results show that the developed travel-time predictive model demonstrates satisfactory performance.

AB This paper presents a unified approach for improving travel demand models through the application and extension of supernetwork models of multi-dimensional travel choices. Proposed quite some time ago, supernetwork models solved to stochastic user equilibrium can provide a simultaneous solution to trip generation, distribution, mode choice, and assignment that is consistent with disaggregate models and predicts their aggregate effects. The extension to incorporate the time dimension through the use of dynamic equilibrium assignment methods is proposed as an enhancement that is necessary in order to produce realistic models. A variety of theoretical and practical problems are identified whose solution underlies implementation of this approach. Recommended future research includes improved algorithms for stochastic and dynamic equilibrium assignment, new methods for calibrating assignment models, and the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology for data and model management.

AB The lack of hydrogen fuel stations is a major barrier to the introduction of hydrogen vehicles. Given the high cost of constructing hydrogen stations, it is desirable to build as few stations as possible while still adequately serving consumers. Although several studies have addressed the general question of how many stations are needed, the literature has been largely silent on how to relate the location of stations to the sufficient number of hydrogen stations. A geographic information system (GIS) provides a tool for evaluating station siting decisions as part of a greater hydrogen network. A GIS model was developed for siting generic hydrogen stations in Sacramento County, California, with the economics of supplying those stations with hydrogen ignored for now. The analysis used average one-way driving time from home or work to a station as a metric to evaluate scenarios. When a network is posited with 30% as many retail fuel stations as now exist, average driving time from home to a station would be 16 s more than it is with the full existing network of stations. With 5% of existing stations supplying hydrogen (or any other alternative fuel), the average driving time to a station could be as little as 4 min in Sacramento County. These estimates assume free-flow traffic; actual times will vary. This modeling approach provides an analytical framework for siting early hydrogen fuel stations. Initial results suggest a few strategically sited stations could be sufficient to satisfy a large number of prospective consumers.

AB Because of high data collection costs, analysts are commonly faced with the problem of limited data in the evaluation of intelligent transportation systems. How reliable are conclusions based on small samples? If limited data are available, how does one maximize their value? These questions were addressed to evaluate the potential benefits of prospective notification-based traveler information services used to deliver pretrip travel time information to simulated drivers in a Cincinnati, Ohio, case study. In Cincinnati, travel time data were initially available for only 30 weekdays. An analysis that used this small data set indicated that an advanced traveler information system (ATIS) user would reduce disutility by 32% versus a comparable nonuser. However, since trip experiences on 30 weekdays may not characterize the typical experience of a commuter, conclusions drawn from the small sample may not accurately represent a more generalized assessment of the benefits of ATIS. Hence, an analogue of statistical resampling (experimental resampling) was applied to generate a large sample of days over which the effectiveness of ATIS could be evaluated. With experimental resampling, the reduction in disutility for an ATIS user was only 24%. It was concluded that experimental resampling provided a more reliable estimate of the benefit. To validate the claim, a more extensive study used 154 weekdays spanning a year. The validation analysis found that when compared with the small sample of 30 weekdays, the resampled cases were better predictors of the benefits for the large sample of 154 weekdays.

AB Previous studies have examined hospital accessibility issues, and other work has exhaustively investigated several aspects of roadway crashes, such as their severity and frequency, possible causal factors, and their clustering on networks. However, the nature of the relationship between them, in the accessibility of severe crash hotspots to hospitals with emergency services, is relatively unexplored. Looking at both elements simultaneously is especially critical, given the need to provide the necessary aid to crash victims in a timely manner to help reduce roadway deaths. To the authors' knowledge, such an assessment has not been attempted before. The objective of this study was twofold. First, the study investigated accessibility through the use of geographic information systems and statistical analysis to detect high-risk locations. Second, the study used hierarchical multinomial logistic regression analysis to examine several environmental, traffic, and human factors to identify the determinants of the crashes that constitute hotspots. The results show that several roadway segments portend an elevated threat of injury and fatalities for drivers and passengers, not only due to a higher probability of being severely injured, but also because of the low accessibility to hospitals having emergency services. The results suggest that particular spatial, traffic, and roadway factors, such as intersection presence or speed limits, substantially imperil traffic safety. The knowledge gained from this study can help agencies and officials pinpoint and investigate high-risk locations to enhance the safety of roadway users.

AB In recent years, the development of geographical information systems (GIS) has shifted significantly from desktop applications to mobile field applications. Integrating the precision location data collection capability of a Global Positioning System (GPS) and the spatial processing power of mobile GIS provides an adequate system for field workers to collect data with increased efficiency and ease. This research aims to design and implement a pavement-distress data collection prototype for inspecting airport pavement condition, with the aid of mobile GIS. Unlike the traditional paper forms, the data collection system seeks to offer a customized user interface for distress data entry and a spatial query service. Initial preparation of the airport map layers was carried out on desktop computer using a variety of off-the-shelf software. The required files were then transferred to the personal digital assistant (PDA) for field trials. Two other handheld devices, namely the GPS receiver and digital camera, are attached to the PDA to capture precise location coordinates and digital photos, respectively, of the identified distress. The users are also able to obtain comprehensive search results of the distresses, in both an attribute table and map visualization form. To increase the search efficiency, an indexing method was implemented for the data collected. Trial experimental results show that the applied indexing method has significantly improved the search efficiency over the conventional exhaustive search method.

AB The increasing complexity and demand of transport services strains transportation systems especially in urban areas with limited possibilities for building new infrastructure. The solution to this challenge requires changes of travel behavior. One of the proposed means to induce such change is multimodal travel apps. However, understanding the motivators underlying individuals' travel intentions is essential to design and evaluate their effectiveness. This paper pinpoints and analyses the drivers and barriers that influence individual travel decisions when using such apps. The analytical framework relies on Alderfer's ERG model of human needs that relate the individual's intentions to three domains, namely (1) Existence, (2) Relatedness and (3) Growth needs. Furthermore, environmental attitude, information privacy concerns and perceived difficulties when using the system are incorporated as to better explain user-sided heterogeneity. The case-study focuses on a new travel information system in Copenhagen (Denmark), which is not yet operational, through a technology-use preference survey among 828 travelers. Structural equation models revealed that the motivation for choices are specific to individual users and depend on wide-ranging factors that go beyond traditional economic and socio-demographic methods. The study revealed (1) different intentions among individuals according to the perceived value of the new information system, (2) a relation between different environmental attitude constructs and users' needs, (3) a stronger appeal to use the system for individuals with higher needs of developing social self-concept and eco-travel self-efficacy as well as with lower perceived privacy risk and perceived difficulties, (4) that both functional and psychological factors affect adoption intention.

AB Falling trees pose a great hazard to the safe and uninterrupted use of the road transportation system during storm events. The present process of manually identifying potentially hazardous trees is laborious and inefficient. This paper presents a novel methodology for automating the tree threat identification process by using airborne laser altimetry data and a geographical information system (GIS). This methodology has the potential to be used for selecting the best possible evacuation routes based on tree hazards. The proposed method harnesses the power of spatial analysis functionality provided by existing GIS software and high-quality, three-dimensional (3D) data obtained from an airborne laser scanning system. This paper highlights the benefits related to using: (1) Height calculation of tall objects; (2) identification of hazardous objects; and (3) object identification from irregular 3D light detection and ranging point data over the currently employed manual methods.

TI Assessing expected accuracy of probe vehicle travel time reports
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of probe vehicles to provide estimates of link. travel times has been suggested as a means of obtaining travel times within signalized networks for use in advanced travel information systems. Past research in the literature has provided contradictory conclusions regarding the expected accuracy of these probe-based estimates, and consequently has estimated different levels of market penetration of probe vehicles required to sustain accurate data within an advanced traveler information system. This paper examines the effect of sampling bias on the accuracy of the: probe estimates. Pin analytical expression is derived on the basis of queuing theory to prove that bias in arrival time distributions and/or in the proportion of probes associated with each link departure turning movement will lead to a systematic bias in the sample estimate of the mean delay. Subsequently, the potential for and impact of sampling bias on a signalized link is examined by simulating an arterial corridor. The analytical derivation and the simulation analysis show hat the reliability of probe-based average link travel times is highly affected by sampling bias. Furthermore, this analysis shows that the contradictory conclusions of previous research are directly related to the presence or absence of sample bias.

AB Input-output cumulative count curves are a powerful tool to forecast freeway travel times in the very short term, as they rely on the predictive information given by the vehicles' accumulation in the target section. Therefore, they could represent a very appealing method to feed real-time traffic information systems. However, traffic detectors' count drift implies very poor accuracy in the estimation of the vehicles' accumulation, leading to completely unreliable travel time predictions. A drift correction method is necessary. In contrast, several technologies allow accurate direct travel time measurements, like automatic vehicle identification (AVI) or vehicle tracking systems. In all cases, direct travel time measurements are obtained once the vehicle has crossed the target section. This means that the information is representative of the near past traffic conditions, while the objective of real-time information systems is to transmit information about traffic conditions in the near future. In this context, the present paper aims to fuse the information provided by input-output diagrams, obtained from loop detectors, with AVI direct travel time measurements. This fusion allows exploiting the accuracy of the direct measurements to correct the count drift in loop detectors. Then, corrected input-output curves can be used to obtain reliable short-term predictions of travel times. The proposed data fusion method has been applied to a test site in the AP7 freeway near Barcelona, obtaining significantly better results than with the common practices of simply disseminating direct measurements or using spot-speed methods.

TI Traveler Information Delivery Mechanisms Impact on Consumer Behavior
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID SYSTEMS
AB Advanced traveler information systems (ATISs) help individuals make informed travel decisions. Current ATIS applications encompass a variety of delivery mechanisms, including the Internet, telephone, television, radio, variable message signs, and in-vehicle navigation devices to support decisions about destinations, travel mode, departure time, routes, parking, and trip cancellation. It is important for researchers and practitioners to review the status of ATIS technologies and to understand travelers' access and response to current ATIS deployment. Focusing on largely public-sector delivery mechanisms, this study answers two fundamental questions: whether accessing more information sources is associated with a higher likelihood of travel decision adjustments and which technologies are more likely to elicit substantive adjustments to routine travel. These questions are answered by using a comprehensive and recent behavioral data set, collected in the Research Triangle area or North Carolina. The study generates useful knowledge about how to operate existing traveler information systems more efficiently and how to improve them in the future.

AB Geographic information systems (GIS) have been used for more than a decade to display crash sites. Now that their novelty has worn off, the traffic records community should ask what additional analytical benefits GIS can uniquely provide. A literature review illustrates that safety-related GIS analytical capabilities surpass the common practice of producing crash location pin maps. Additional useful GIS techniques include using grid-based modeling; producing increasingly accurate collision diagrams; verifying disparate sources of crash data; applying spatially based statistical applications; examining crash location patterns for causal factors; aligning public opinion with real data; and improving routing capabilities for pedestrians, bicyclists, and hazardous material carriers. This research explores GIS analytic capabilities that can be practically applied to crash data evaluation. A case study demonstrates that despite limited budgets and imperfect data, GIS can still help to identify potential crash countermeasures. Using a typical non-GIS source of crash data (a software package that records crashes at either an intersection or a midblock location), it was possible to place approximately 82 percent of crash locations within a GIS. When private property crashes were excluded from this process, the placement rate climbed to an estimated 94 percent for intersections and 87 percent for midblock locations, By focusing the case study on understanding the practical spatial analytical capabilities rather than merely the mechanics of specific GIS software, one can eventually take advantage of the more extensive crash and roadway data sets that will become available. Despite its many capabilities, however, GIS has not eliminated the need for a comprehensive safety analysis framework integrating the spatial and statistical queries necessary for engineering, enforcement, or educational improvements.

   willingness-to-pay
AB Web-enabled public transport (PT) information systems that combine information on different PT modes, different PT companies and different geographical regions, can be built to improve the accessibility of public transportation. As the potential list of information aspects that can be included in such systems is long, it is interesting to examine the relative importance of different information aspects. This study reports the relative importance travelers attach to a range of information aspects. In addition, the willingness to pay for this information was examined by conducting a stated choice experiment, in which price was traded off against groupings of information aspects. The results of the study indicate that even though public transport travel information is highly price sensitive, travelers are willing to pay for it if the information systems provide additional functionality such as real-time information and, to a lesser extent, additional trip planning options.

AB This Paper describes the development of solutions to traffic congestion throughout the UK and Europe. It outlines in particular Strathclyde Regional Council's response to the problem-the Centrally Integrated Traffic Control (CITRAC) concept. This computerized traffic control system is an attempt to deal with urban transport problems at a regional level where the institutional and operational obstructions seen elsewhere are considerably reduced.
   The Paper suggests that experiences gained from the CITRAC project are invaluable, are applicable to many other control or information system projects, and are worth consideration by others embarking upon such projects.

AB This article tackles the problem of a vehicle's geolocalization in urban areas. For this purpose, Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver is the main sensor. However, the use of GPS alone is not sufficient in many urban environments. GPS has to be helped with dead-reckoned sensors, map data, and cameras. A novel observation of the absolute pose of the vehicle is proposed to back up GPS and the drift of dead-reckoned sensors. This approach uses a new source of information that is a geographical 3-dimensional (3D) model of the environment in which the vehicle navigates. This virtual 3D city model is managed in real time by a 3D geographical information system (3D GIS). This pose's observation is constructed by matching the virtual image provided by the 3D GIS and the real image acquired by an onboard camera. An extended Kalman filter combines the sensors measurements to produce an estimation of the vehicle's pose. Experimental results using data from an odometer, a gyroscope, a GPS receiver, a camera, and an accurate geographical 3D model of the environment illustrate the developed approach.

AB A geographic information system-based multivariate regression study of an urban U.S. carsharing operator compared the use of carsharing vehicles for 16 months in 2006 and 2007 to built-environment and demographic factors. Carsharing is a relatively new transportation industry in which companies provide members with short-term vehicle access from distributed neighborhood locations. The number of registered carsharing members in North America has doubled every year or two to a current level of approximately 320,000. Researchers have long supposed that public transit access is a key factor driving demand for carsharing. The results of the study, however, find an ambiguous relationship between the activity at carsharing locations and public transit access. Light rail availability is found to have a significant and positive relationship to carsharing demand. Regional rail availability is found to be weakly and negatively associated with carsharing demand, although limitations in the available data make it impossible to ascribe the observed difference to user demand, random variation, or other factors specific to the industry.

AB A pavement-rehabilitation planning system enabled by a geographical information system (GIS) is described; it can perform multiyear project-linked network pavement-rehabilitation analyses subject to funding availability, minimum performance requirements, and other constraints. The system first uses information on the current and historical project-level pavement-condition evaluation stored in the central database to forecast project performance ratings and distresses. It then determines appropriate rehabilitation methods and costs and, finally, calculates life-cycle cost-effectiveness ratios for all projects in the pavement network. With this information, the program performs analyses to determine multiyear minimum funding required to meet prescribed pavement-performance requirements and constraints and to determine optimum pavement-rehabilitation plans subject to funding availability and other requirements, such as balancing funding distribution or future pavement performance among state congressional districts or Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) districts. The system uses dynamic segmentation to create GIS maps, links them with the central database and network analysis results, and thus allows users to make changes to the rehabilitation plans directly on the GIS maps and have the changes reflected automatically in the database. Several examples using the actual data on historical pavement condition evaluations from GDOT are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the system.

AB FHWA created the Road Weather Management Program within the Office of Transportation Operations to develop weather information systems, improve winter maintenance technologies, and improve road weather management practices for all weather threats. The program identified winter road maintenance decision support as a priority. In 1999, the program sponsored the Surface Transportation Weather Decision Support Requirements project to study surface transportation decision making, with a focus on winter road maintenance, and to create an operational concept description (OCD) for an advanced decision-support system to improve the current Road Weather Information System. Described are the findings on winter road maintenance decision making that went into the OCD and the plans for further development of an advanced decision-support application within the Intelligent Transportation System.

AB Historically, inland marine transportation has been one of the most efficient and reliable modes of commercial freight transportation. However, hazardous material shipments have become more common on inland waterways, creating concerns about the dissemination of shipment information to land-based emergency responders immediately following an incident. Marine transportation accidents have demonstrated that a spill involving hazardous materials near a major urban area can have devastating consequences. For these reasons a prototypical decision support system for inland marine transportation risk management has been developed. The system is designed to support real-time response as well as planning decisions such as risk resource allocation and evaluation of potential response strategies. It can be applied to barge accidents as well as counterterrorism planning activities. The system is based on the integration of geographic information systems (GIS), database management systems, Global Positioning Systems, and the Internet. In the event of an incident, this system enables en route responders to view incident details via an Internet GIS map service. The map service contains data that describe land use, population, and dispersion results for air and surface water at downstream intakes. To illustrate system capability, a recent accident is re-created to show how the response could have been improved with system access. A case study showing planning applications is also provided.

   object detection; traffic information systems; video registration
AB This paper investigates airborne helicopter video for estimating traffic parameters. Roll, pitch, and yaw of the helicopter make the video unstable, difficult to view, and the derived parameters less accurate. To correct this, a frame-by-frame video-registration technique using a feature tracker to automatically determine control-point correspondences is proposed. This converts the spatio-temporal video into temporal information, thereby correcting for airborne platform motion and attitude errors. The registration is robust, with the residual jitter being less than a few pixels over hundreds of frames. A simple vehicle-detection scheme identifies vehicle locations in the video, which are then tracked by the feature tracker, enabling us to estimate average velocity, instantaneous velocity, and other parameters automatically to within 10% of manual measurements. The entire process of registration, detection, tracking, and estimation takes only a few seconds for each frame. A prototype multimedia geographic information system (GIS) is created as a visualization tool for viewing the registered video, other airborne or satellite imagery, and data pertaining to georeferenced locations within a base map.

AB This paper describes a new methodology to explore the operational performance of on-road transit on a network-level basis. The approach mines stop-level automatic vehicle location (AVL) data and uses new visualization methodologies in geographical information systems (GIS) to explore spatial and temporal patterns of changes in operational performance. The focus is a large historical AVL data set for the tram (streetcar) network of Melbourne, Australia. A major aim is to illustrate how a spatial perspective on networks can improve understanding of transit operational performance. AVL records for 24,451 tram vehicle trips in March 2001 and 26,155 trips in March 2004 were analyzed for 175 tram stops. Arrival travel times and differences between scheduled and actual arrival times were computed for each stop. The Arcview GIS system and spatial surface interpretation with the inverse distance weighted methodology were used to explore spatial variations in the data. Five analyses explored network variations in operational performance: (a) an analysis of tram travel time to Melbourne's central business district, (b) a reliability analysis exploring variations between actual versus scheduled travel time for 2001, (c) an examination of 2001 tram travel time variation with the use of the coefficient of variation, (d) an analysis of changes in tram travel times between 2001 and 2004, and (e) a trend analysis of changes in tram reliability from 2001 to 2004 with the use of the coefficient of variation. Overall the analysis demonstrated that a networkwide and spatial perspective in exploring the operational performance of large transit systems was a new, original, and worthwhile approach to identify transit issues for further investigation.

AB Both the geographic information system (GIS) and transportation modeling environments have seen continually developing analytic concepts and techniques. However, these developments have seldom resulted in the integration of GISs and transportation models. This paper explores the potential inherent in merging of these environments through a systematic investigation of the fundamental basis of integration. To do this, the traditional four step transportation modeling process is extended to include input and output steps. We then define functional components for GIS data handling - data management, manipulation, and analysis. The steps of modeling are matched against the list of GIS data handling functions within a matrix-based framework. GIS functions that enhance a land-use based urban transportation modeling process are then categorized. Conclusions are drawn and directions for future developments are discussed.

DE GIS-T; data sharing; data models; linear locational referencing systems
AB This paper develops a framework and principles for sharing transportation data, The framework is intended to clarify roles among participants, data producers, data integrators, and data users. The principles are intended to provide guidance for the participants, Both the framework and the principles are based on an enterprise geographic information systems-transportation (GIS-T) data model that defines relations among transportation data elements. The data model guards against ambiguities and provides a basis for the development of the framework and principles for sharing transportation data.
   There are two central principles. First is the uncoupling of graphics. topology, position, and characteristics. Second is the establishment of a schema for transportation features and their identifiers. An underlying principle is the need for a common data model that holds transportation features, not their graphical representations, as the objects of interest. Attributes of transportation features are represented as linear and point events. These are located along the feature using linear referencing. Sharing of transportation data involves exchange of relevant transportation features and events, not links and nodes of apylication-specific databases. Strategies for sharing transportation features follow from this approach. The key strategy is to identify features in the database to facilitate a transactional update system, one that does not require rebuilding the entire database anew, This feature-oriented enterprise GIS-T database becomes the basis for building separate application-specific network databases.

AB Literature demonstrating how to use geographic information systems (GIS) effectively for transit origin-destination (O-D) data analysis is rather inadequate to date. Other than geocoding O-D survey data to point locations, not much attention has been accorded GIS as either a tool for checking survey data quality or for validation of data analysis. The purpose here is to demonstrate how the Orange County Transportation Authority applied GIS technology effectively to project transit passengers' mobility patterns with greater accuracy and consequently strengthen the validation database for travel demand forecasting analysis with respect to transit planning. In addition to the use of traditional statistical methods for weighting procedures, this study relied on analytical GIS functions to achieve the following two objectives: (a) incorporation of the spatial element while expanding the weighting factors, and (b) validation of the weighted O-D survey returns with passenger counting data derived from other independent data sources. This project demonstrates both the usefulness of GIS technology in its ability to improve the quality of travel survey data and its value in combination with weighting-factors expansion methodology. In addition to the traditional statistical weighting methodology, a spatial component was incorporated as a criterion for enhancing the expansion results of the O-D data. Furthermore, comparative analysis with transit passenger counts and transfer data volumes were used to validate the findings of the weighting methodology. The results support the conclusion that GIS can greatly improve O-D data quality and statistical representation.

TI Examination of Traveler Responses to Real-Time Information About Bus
   Arrivals Using Panel Data
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB In recent years, a considerable amount of money has been spent on intelligent transportation system projects for public transportation, most notably, real-time transit information systems. To date, strikingly few studies that have empirically investigated the effects of deployment of such a system have been completed. This paper examines the effects of real-time transit information on travelers' behavior and psychology. The 2006-2007 University of Maryland (College Park) campus transportation panel survey data were used to examine how travelers responded to the ShuttleTrac system, a newly implemented real-time bus arrival information system for the university's shuttle service. Two fixed-effects models and five random-effects-ordered probit models were estimated to sort out the causal relations between ShuttleTrac system information use and two behavioral and five psychological indicators, respectively. It was found that use of the real-time information significantly increased the riders' feelings of security about riding the bus after dark and boosted their overall level of satisfaction. However, it was not found to significantly increase travelers' shuttle trip frequency, at least in the short term, perhaps because of a lack of enough time for adjustment of travel behavior. These results suggest that although transit agencies and scholars should not be too optimistic about achieving an immediate ridership increase by providing real-time information to travelers, they can expect positive psychological responses from transit riders.

AB In October 2004, about 9 lane km of deteriorated truck lanes on Interstate 15 at Devore in Southern California was rebuilt during 18 days with extended one roadbed full-closures with the counterflow traffic system and 24-h construction operations. The project implemented the automated work zone information system (AWIS) to reduce peak hour delay during construction by changing road user's travel patterns and diverting traffic to detour routes. This paper describes the design, performance, and validation of AWIS with monitored traffic data before and during construction used. The AWIS was installed to provide road users with real-time travel information so that they could avoid traffic delays in the construction work zone (CWZ) corridor. Travel times through the CWZ were estimated from speed data and enhanced in two ways: (a) portable and permanent changeable message signs on site and (b) off-site (project website) implementation with travel time messages, traffic snapshots, and video streaming. AWIS travel time was estimated at 90% of actual travel times as measured by probe vehicles. The peak hour traffic demand through the CWZ was reduced by up to 18%, with significant volume increases to detour freeways. The AWIS operation contributed to a decrease in the maximum delay for weekday peak hours (from expected 90 min to measured 50 min on average during construction). The outcome of this study will help transportation agencies and practitioners efficiently design and operate AWIS for highway rehabilitation under high traffic volume.

AB This paper develops a travelers' route choice behavior model when using an advanced traveler information system (ATIS). The model is tested with data obtained from a computer simulation. The paper's point of departure is that immediately perceived travel time along different routes, previously gained experience, and the degree of preference when choosing a specific route are characterized by fuzziness. The travelers' route choice behavior model thus developed is based on fuzzy logic. The results obtained;using the model show exceptionally good agreement with results obtained using computer simulation.

TI Automatic Identification of Roadway Horizontal Alignment Information
   Using Geographic Information System Data: CurvS Tool
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID EXTRACTION
AB This paper introduces CurvS, a web-based tool for researchers and analysts that automatically extracts, visualizes, and analyzes roadway horizontal alignment information using readily available geographic information system roadway centerline data. The functionalities of CurvS are presented along with a brief background on its methodology. The validation of its estimation results are presented using actual horizontal alignment data from two different roadway types: Route 83, a two-lane two-way rural roadway in New Jersey and I-80, a freeway segment in Nevada. Different metrics are used for validation. These are identification rates of curved and tangent sections, overlap ratio of curved and tangent sections between estimated and actual horizontal alignment data, and percent fit of curve radii. The validation results show that CurvS is able to identify all the curves on these two roadways, and the estimated section lengths are significantly close to the actual alignment data, especially for the I-80 freeway segment, where 90% of curved length and 94% of tangent section length are correctly matched. Even when curves have small central angles, such as the ones in Route 83, CurvS's estimations covers 71% of curved length and 96% of tangent section length.

AB Couriers undertaking deliveries in Central Business Districts (CBDs) often have difficulty conducting efficient routes due to the uncertainty associated with the availability of loading zones. Delivery routes for courier vehicles operating in central city areas involve a combination of driving and walking paths for delivering goods to multiple receivers. Sensor technologies are becoming available that can provide real time information regarding the availability and occupancy of loading zones. Utilization of occupancy information can reduce transport costs for couriers as well as emissions and congestion levels within CBDs. Booking systems allow loading zones to be reserved for delivery vehicles.
   This paper describes an agent-based simulation model combined with optimization procedures developed to predict the behavior of courier drivers in CBDs. The model, which allows couriers routes to be optimized based on minimizing both driving and walking costs, was applied to study the effects for introducing a loading zone occupancy information as well as estimate the potential limitations compared to a reservation system. The consequences of permitting waiting at loading zones as well as duration limits are predicted.
   Lower driving times were estimated when real time availability and average occupancy information of loading zones were provided when no waiting was permitted. This was found to be more pronounced when there were no duration limits at loading zones. However, when waiting at loading zones was permitted, only marginal driving time savings were predicted when real time availability and average occupancy information were provided. Despite that, compared to the case when an ideal reservation system was employed for couriers to conduct the best possible delivery plan, the information systems still had opportunities for further enhancements in driving times in periods of high demand, although only marginal savings in driving times could be made when waiting at loading zones was allowed.

AB This paper proposes a deterministic mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for downstream petroleum supply chain (PSC) network to determine the optimal distribution center (DC) locations, capacities, transportation modes, and transfer volumes. The model minimizes multi-echelon multi-product cost along the refineries, distribution centers, transportation modes and demand nodes. The relationship between strategic planning and multimodal transportation is further elucidated. A case study was considered with real data from the U.S. petroleum industry and transportation networks within Geographic Information System (GIS). A scenario analysis is also conducted to demonstrate the impact of key parameters on PSC decisions and total cost. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Locating Soil Tests with Intelligent Compaction Data and Geographic
   Information System Technology
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Intelligent compaction is gaining popularity as a tool for evaluating soil compaction. Unfortunately, intelligent compaction equipment collects an overwhelming amount of data, especially for an inspector who is making decisions in the field. The goal of this approach is to identify optimal places to perform field compaction tests on the basis of relative compaction values. This paper presents a geographic information system application that analyzes and views intelligent compaction data to support in-field decision making. To facilitate the analysis, intelligent compaction data were converted from geographic coordinates into a regularized station and offset coordinate system. A grid of points at 1-ft intervals was placed over the intelligent compaction data, and spatial analysis tools were used to average the compaction values within various distances of the grid points. On the assumption that 95% of a soil lift must be compacted correctly, statistical analyses were performed to identify points that fell between the 4th and 6th percentiles of the compaction value. A positive outcome from field compaction tests at these locations would indicate that at least 95% of the lift was properly compacted; a negative outcome would indicate that less than 95% of the lift was compacted adequately and that additional compaction work was required.

AB Accurate annual average daily traffic (AADT) information is important to many applications, including roadway design, air quality compliance, travel model validation, and others. Yet complete or even extensive coverage of a network to collect traffic count data is impractical because of the cost involved. Studies have been conducted to estimate AADT for interstate highways, expressways, urban roads, and rural roads. Such efforts were often hampered by the lack of relevant detailed information that adequately explained variations in the traffic counts. A study in which geographic information system technology was extensively used to investigate various factors that may contribute to AADT on a road is presented. A variety of land-use and accessibility measurements were developed and tested. Multiple linear regression models were developed. Although most variables were statistically significant, few added enough explanatory power to be practical and useful. Four models that achieved R-2 of 0.66 to 0.82 are presented. The predictive power of the models are also examined and compared.

AB In order to increase the sustainability of transportation in cities, streets must provide infrastructures that favor active and public transportation modes. However, the current decision making processes in transportation projects do not always explicitly take into account sustainable transportation requirements and often ignore concerns that may arise in other fields such as environmental protection, health, or urban design. The proposed framework in this paper aims at integrating sustainability in a decision-making process by creating better collaboration and communication between professionals of such disparate fields. The framework is based on group workshops, problem structuring, multi-criteria decision aiding and geographic information systems. It was applied in Quebec City, Canada. The objective of the workshops was to identify higher priority streets that should be redesigned as Complete Streets, a popular movement that advocates "streets for everyone" in North America. To facilitate communication and use for future decisions, the results of the analysis were integrated and presented in a geographic information system. As a result, this user-friendly tool is currently used to support decision-making by Quebec City officials who must choose the streets to be redesigned as Complete Streets while ensuring transparency and traceability. Such an approach may better support policies to make the transport system more sustainable by integrating various considerations, being transparent and improving communication of the outcome.

AB Disruptions to transportation networks can be very costly. However, managing disruptions and the costs associated with these events, poses some challenges. Transport networks are, in many cases, large and complex. This paper develops a method, based on complex network theory, to analyse transportation networks. It provides a way, through the use raster-based geographic information system (GIS) techniques, to identify critical nodes or links in a network that reflect spatial interdependencies with other networks and to assess how resilient the networks are to failures of these locations. For purposes of illustration, the method is applied to the network of major roads and rail in the State of Florida.

AB On August 22, 1996, President William Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. This legislation, widely known as the welfare reform act, transformed welfare from a long-term support program into one with a primary objective of moving people off the welfare rolls into gainful employment in the shortest possible time. The passage of this act renewed a long-standing debate over whether improved public transit would lessen the length of time that people remain on welfare. Studies addressing this issue draw different conclusions from their methodological differences in measuring transit accessibility indices and in using aggregate versus disaggregate data. A new study uses distance-decay parameters estimated by a measure of transit accessibility based on origin-destination data and thereby addresses the arbitrary selection of distance-decay parameters in the accessibility equation used by earlier studies. It also uses disaggregate data at the individual level to overcome the shortcomings of earlier studies. Based on welfare recipients in Broward County, Florida, an analysis using a geographic information system and the Florida Standard Urban Transportation Modeling Structure reveals that there is a statistically significant inverse association between transit accessibility to jobs and length of time spent on welfare. This association implies that transit accessibility plays a significant role in the employment prospects of welfare recipients in the study area.

TI Index for Estimating Road Vulnerability to Damage from Overweight
   Vehicles Data Based on Geographic Information System
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB One component of North Carolina's motor carrier enforcement program is focused on overweight trucks. The aim of this enforcement program is to protect the state's roadway infrastructure, and as such it is important to identify those facilities and roadway segments that are most susceptible to damage from overweight vehicles. For that purpose, a quantitative road vulnerability index (RVI) was developed. Vulnerability is expressed as a function of truck volume, pavement condition, and bridge condition. By weighting these factors, one can assign vulnerability values to road segments statewide. Vulnerable road segments are then mapped in the same geographic information system (GIS) environment used to capture and display motor carrier enforcement activities for overweight violations. In addition to providing information to aid in the spatial assignment of weight enforcement activities, the RVI uses GIS data as a useful tool for the visual analysis and integration of roadway maintenance and operations concerns across various divisions of the North Carolina Department of Transportation.

TI COMMUTERS ENROUTE DIVERSION AND RETURN DECISIONS - ANALYSIS AND
   IMPLICATIONS FOR ADVANCED TRAVELER INFORMATION-SYSTEMS
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
AB Incident-induced congestion is a major source of delay and frustration for drivers in large urban areas. Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) have been proposed within the framework of Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS) to address one component of the incident-induced congestion problem: diversion of drivers to alternate routes. To fully utilize the potential of ATIS, transportation managers need to understand driver response to such congestion. This study examines short-term commuter response to unexpected (incident-induced) congestion. It investigates factors which influence diversion from the regular route and return to the regular route after diversion. Discrete choice models of diversion and return behavior show that the following information and trip factors increase the probability of diversion: delay information received from radio traffic reports as opposed to observation of congestion, longer delays and longer travel times, and number of alternate routes used in the past. Further, drivers were more likely to divert if they lived in the city as opposed to the suburbs, were risk seekers, had a higher stated propensity to divert and were male. However, anticipated congestion on the alternate route inhibited drivers from diverting. Finally, drivers who had longer commute trips were more likely to return to their regular route. The most important implication for designing ATIS is that traffic information must be ''customized'' to account for individual differences. Specific design implications are discussed in the paper.

   model for routing hurricane disaster relief goods
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

ID BOUND ALGORITHM; TRANSPORTATION; BRANCH; RISK
AB Recent weather events, particularly in the southeastern United States, have brought issues of hurricane disaster planning to the forefront of public policy. Efficient distribution of relief goods to populations after severe weather events is one of many challenges faced by governing bodies. This paper focuses on provision of hurricane disaster relief and develops a flexible network flow model that provides efficient transport linkages between critical elements of the relief goods supply chain. The model identifies accessible locations in which to place intraurban distribution sites for relief goods. Flexibility inherent in the model structure allows the pursuit of multiple policies, including the ability to trade off the costs paid for constructing various components of the goods supply chain. The model is linked to a geographic information system and can be used to visualize relief planning scenarios. The results of model tests with sample spatial data demonstrate how average population time to relief facilities (accessibility) varies substantially depending on the cost structure input into the model. Conclusions and several suggestions for future research are provided.

TI Mapping Oversized and Overweight Truck Routes with Procedure Based on
   Geographic Information Systems
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Effective and sufficient support for the transportation of oversized and overweight (OS-OW) loads on the nation's transportation system is important to a vibrant economy. The availability of advanced tools and technologies based on geographic information systems (GIS) has increased considerably the ability of transportation policy makers to analyze vehicle routing data better. The Texas Department of Transportation recently initiated a research effort to analyze the routes of historically permitted OS-OW loads. The primary objectives of this research included the development of criteria for assigning current and projected OS-OW groups to an improved road network, the identification of strategic infrastructure improvements to accommodate such loads, and the development of optimal and alternative routes for priority load groups between the most common origins and destinations. As part of the project, the research team developed a highly efficient GIS-mapping approach and converted a massive data set of OS-OW permit routes into a GIS format. The mapping approach enabled batch processing and directly queried, retrieved, and stored data from and to an Oracle database. This paper presents part of the findings of this research, with a focus on the GIS mapping process of the historical OS-OW permit routes. The GIS approach will be particularly valuable for those states that are, or will be, automating their process for OS-OW permitting through GIS-based tools. In addition, the research provides valuable lessons for other states that are looking for a workable solution to analyze effectively mass historical OS-OW routing data.

AB This paper presents the first usage of road surface defects as a means of vehicle position detection. Whilst several applications are possible, this work focuses on use in Formula E racing, where several driver information systems depend heavily upon accurate vehicle position estimation, including energy management advice and split time information, and where use of common positioning systems such as GPS is forbidden. Teams currently estimate the position on track by integrating vehicle speed, but this is susceptible to error accumulation throughout a lap, diminishing the precision and value of driver information systems. This work presents a method to improve the vehicle's position estimate by detecting bumps in the road surface using suspension damper displacement data, an approach which is novel because it is independent of common positioning techniques such as GPS. These bumps are used as positionally-fixed checkpoints around the track, allowing the positional estimate to be regularly corrected, mitigating drift in the original estimated position. Results of the bump detection algorithm developed show for the first time that this technique can pinpoint the vehicle position with a precision of 1.41m standard deviation, with scope for further improvement. This result is significant for positioning surface vehicles where other more standard techniques are precluded. In the Formula E application the approach is found to improve the precision (consistency) of the vehicle positional estimate for large parts of the circuit, which will allow higher quality and more reliable information to be given to the driver, thereby giving a competitive advantage.

AB This study examined the North American Industrial Classification System based manufacturing industry (NAICS 31-33) from 1997 to 2010 in a cost-based framework. First, both profit and production function models were constructed and estimated for the U.S. manufacturing industry at the state level to allow for spatial spillovers and interactions. A model based on profit and production provided an alternative approach to the dual-cost function. Elasticities associated with infrastructure investment and industry total costs were determined by the inclusion of data on transportation infrastructure spending. Results of the spatial econometric models and the computed elasticities were then delivered in a geographic information system.

TI Application of Advanced Traffic Information Systems Field Test of a
   Travel-Time Prediction System with Widely Spaced Detectors
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
AB With increased congestion in most urban networks, providing reliable trip times to commuters has emerged as a critical challenge for all existing advanced traffic information systems. This paper presents the development and evaluation of a hybrid travel-time prediction model in a demonstration system sponsored by the Maryland State Highway Administration. The automated real-time travel-time prediction system is located on a 25-mi stretch of 1-70 eastbound from MD-27 to I-695, which includes seven interchanges and 10 traffic detectors. To contend with the resource constraints of more than 1 mi in detector spacing, the proposed prediction model consists of two components: a multitopology neural network model with a clustering function as the main model and an enhanced k nearest neighbor model as the supplemental model. The evaluation results based on estimated travel times and field data collected by a third party indicate that the proposed hybrid model can provide reliable predictions of travel times in real-time operations in uncongested, congested, and transition traffic conditions.

AB This paper considers the environmental justice implications of transportation plans and policies in the US. Despite several administrative orders and federal mandates, few specific guidelines exist for assessing the disproportionate effects of transportation projects and implementing environmental justice principles in the transportation planning process. The paper develops a set of indices to measure the environmental justice impacts of transportation projects; and applies these to evaluate proposed capacity improvement projects in Volusia County, Florida. The indices developed serve as preliminary indicators that address the key research dimensions of environmental justice, meet the requirements of federal mandates that enforce principles of environmental justice, and are formulated on the basis of census data and tools available in geographic information systems software.

AB Increasing demand for railway transportation requires large amounts of money to be spent on maintenance and renewal. In both industrialised and developing countries, one of the main problems of railway companies is regarding track maintenance and renewal. Cost reduction and better control of maintenance processes therefore increase the efficiency of the railway system. The modern railway infrastructure maintenance management system requires a condition-based diagnostic concept covering all railway infrastructure components. This paper describes a decision support system approach, using a tool called MR.GIS (maintenance and renewal based on geographic information system), to analyse the track components and suggests methods for helping the track managers and engineers decide when maintenance is necessary and when is the best time for renewal. The tool enables the users to visualise and analyse the railway track data which is no longer possible using the manual methods. The tool analyses the track with its rich database including decision rules. These decision rules were developed by the specialist professionals and the working procedure of the tool was built on these rules. On the other hand the four major components of GIS, namely encoding, management, analysis and reporting, were integrated with the tool to enable a good advance on planning of maintenance and renewal activities. The developed system was successfully implemented to the railway tracks provided by Turkish State Railways and the expectations of Turkish State Railways were mostly fulfilled.

AB The scheduling operations of many paratransit agencies in the United States are undertaken manually. Those customers who are eligible to travel call in their requests the day before the trip is needed. As the trip requests are received, they are entered into a hst of unscheduled trips. In order to schedule these trips, the scheduler must first determine the number of drivers and shuttle buses that are available as well as the time of availability of each. The scheduler must then try to match the rides that are in "similar" areas around the "same" time to place together on the driver's schedule. As new trip requests are made, the schedulers must adjust the trips that are already scheduled to try and schedule as many trips as possible in the most efficient way.
   By developing a system that would improve the scheduling system operations of, in this case, DART (Delaware Administration for Regional Transit) First State Paratransit, customers can expect to receive better service that will improve their ability to travel throughout the community. Some devices that could also improve the operations of paratransit agencies are described in this paper, such as satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS), radio communication systems, mobile computers, radio frequency-based data communication systems, internet web pages, automated paratransit information systems, and card-based data storage and transfer media. However, because paratransit systems are difficult to operate cost-efficiently, the optimum and most cost-efficient device must be selected. The system chosen for DART First State Paratransit includes the use of a relational database management system (RDMS) and a transportation Geographic Information System (GIS). RDMS keeps track of the database information as well as the scheduled trips and the GIS is ideal for analyzing both geographic and temporal data. This system is shown to be superior to the manual system.

AB Driver awareness of current winter road conditions (RCs) is known to affect the frequency of accidents due to sudden changes in these conditions. For example, partially icy roads that appear during autumn in northern areas typically result in collisions and ditch runs unless the drivers are generally aware of the situation. Availing motorists who drive under winter RCs of enhanced information is therefore highly desirable to increase their awareness of hazardous driving conditions. Such conditions need to be predicted ahead of time and presented to drivers before they attempt slippery road sections. Moreover, the identification of slippery RCs should quickly trigger targeted road maintenance to reduce the risk of accidents. This study presents a scalable and reusable collaborative intelligent transport system, herein referred to as an RC information system (RCIS). RCIS provides accurate RC predictions and forecasts based on RC measurements, road weather observations, and short-term weather forecasts. The prediction methods in the context of the distributed RCIS have been tested using a prototype implementation. These tests confirmed that these inputs could be combined into useful and accurate information about winter RCs that can be adapted for different types of users.

AB The study proposes an easily deployable platform for providing ubiquitous connectivity to public transportation vehicles. The platform is capable to exploit the connectivity offered by heterogeneous wireless networks owned by different operators and it integrates a centralised information system (CIS) which stores the context information (CI) characterising the heterogeneous networks. The study describes the network and traffic monitoring processes, proposes a synchronisation mechanism between the mobile routers of the vehicles and the CIS and a vertical handover (VHO) mechanism adapted to the developed architecture. Simulation results based on CI acquired during field tests are reported in the study. These results validate the developed VHO mechanism using the locally available or the centralised CI.

ID EXTRACTION
AB The geography of horizontal roadway curves is critical to various disciplines, especially to transportation safety, because of their strong correlation with traffic crashes. Remarkably, conventional geographic information system (GIS) roadway centerlines, while fundamental and ubiquitous in current geospatial databases, do not include curve inventories. This study presents an improved method for automatic horizontal curve identification using GIS roadway centerline networks as the data source. Analyzing each vertex of the network geometry, this method identifies the curves by detecting deflections from straight lines using a vertex deflection angle threshold. Different from literature that uses a static threshold, this method develops and applies a dynamic threshold by considering two variables-the roadway speed and the centerline vertex density. The method is capable of self-adjusting using k-means clustering to compensate for uneven centerline digitization. The method can also detect spiral transitions and can handle the complexities of street networks represented using dual centerlines. The testing and validation of the method were performed on a large dataset by applying a combination of goodness of fit metric and visual inspection. The results show that this method improves curve identification accuracy and can provide broader applicability for curve identification using GIS centerlines of various representations and digitization quality in large geographic areas.

AB This paper addresses the problem of integrating advanced traveller information systems (ATIS) and advanced traffic management systems (ATMS). A framework that allows the integration of existing successful control implementations is presented. This framework is utilised to integrate the ATIS/ATMS control decisions of two operational schemes, namely the ATIS stand-alone system, and the ATMS stand-alone control systems, and to form a dual non-cooperative supervisory traffic control system. The two operational schemes are formulated as bi-level optimisation problems. Approximate simulation-based optimisation algorithms are devised as representations of the existing control logic operating these schemes. The schemes' performance is assessed using a simplified network.

ID PRICE
AB The corridor-level impact of a recent major urban highway reconstruction project on residential property values is investigated. The housing market encompassing the North Central Expressway corridor in Dallas, Texas, is examined. Hedonic property price models are estimated for each specific phase of the reconstruction project between 1979 and 1997. Five phases are considered. Geographic information system (GIS) tools, like buffering and geocoding, enable spatial segmentation of property sales and improved model specification facilitated by the creation of different types of proximity variables. An econometric refinement is made to traditional hedonic models that, in conjunction with GIS, allows an examination of spatiotemporal fluctuations in location premiums and property-value trends. The results show that some parts are negatively affected and others are positively affected. This finding is in agreement with the findings of earlier studies. However, this study adds to this conclusion in many ways. The planning process itself mildly affected premiums for those further away. The short-term reconstruction effects are limited to those properties in the immediate vicinity. The results show that the losses in terms of sales discounts during initial phases of construction are made up in the latter phases for those in the immediate vicinity and rebounding property values. The analysis concludes by suggesting that the cost of increased data requirements is outweighed by the informational advantages of the adopted procedure.

TI System for digitizing information on Wisconsin's crash locations
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB One of the key hurdles in identifying unsafe intersections and roadways in Wisconsin is the lack of a complete crash location map, especially for crashes that occurred on local streets. Crash locations are reported in terms of relative offset from an intersection on the basis of on- and at-street name information, which identifies the intersection, and direction and distance information, which identifies the offset. For intersection crashes, the offset distance is typically set to zero. As described in this paper, the Traffic Operations and Safety Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, has developed a system to automate the mapping of Wisconsin local road crash locations. The location mapping algorithm involves the integration of two separate Wisconsin Department of Transportation databases: the Wisconsin crash database of police traffic accident reports and the Wisconsin Information System of Local Roads (WISLR). The application of WISLR, which is an inventory of local roads with details such as traffic information, pavement condition, and roadway geometry, provides invaluable access to more comprehensive safety analysis. Although the methodology introduced is specific to these two databases, the general ideas can be applied to any similar sets of crash and geographic information system databases. The final result is a pinpoint map of all the intersection and segment crashes that occurred on local roads in Wisconsin, along with the complete crash information associated with each mapped crash. The algorithm developed with this methodology is able to map approximately 79 % of the intended pool of available crashes. Quality evaluations indicate that the mapping is almost 98% accurate.

AB A reasonable response to increasing traffic congestion may come from the rapidly developing traveler information systems. Such systems may be successful if they effectively influence drivers' enroute decisions; in this regard, a critical factor may be commuters' willingness to divert from their regular route in response to information about traffic congestion. This study evaluates the effects of real-time traffic information along with driver attributes, roadway characteristics and situational factors on drivers' willingness to divert.
   The empirical portion of this study is based on a survey of downtown Chicago automobile commuters. The stated preference approach was used to study commuters' diversion propensity. Drivers expressed a higher willingness to divert if expected delays on their usual route increased, if the congestion was incident-induced as opposed to recurring, if delay information was received from radio traffic reports compared with observing congestion, and if trip direction was home-to-work rather than work-to-home. Respondents were less willing to divert if their alternate route was unfamiliar, unsafe or had several traffic stops. Socioeconomic characteristics were also significant in predicting willingness to divert.

TI Traffic Information System to Deliver In-Vehicle Messages on Predefined
   Routes Use of Dedicated, Short-Range Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes the architecture and functionality of a work zone traffic information system that uses vehicle-to-vehicle communication, based on dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), and a newly designed hopping algorithm. ("Hopping" involves transmitting traffic messages via intermediate hosts to a target designation. The term is commonly used in the radio and wireless communication industry.) The proposed hopping algorithm can deliver in-vehicle messages transmitted by a roadside unit installed at a work zone site to faraway vehicles traveling toward the work zone on predefined routes. This newly designed hopping algorithm uses rectangular regions to define a hopping route and can hop messages to vehicles on multiple routes at the same time without the risk of creating a broadcast storm. Although the messages hopped by the proposed hopping algorithm will generally be applicable to vehicles on only one side of the road (traveling toward the work zone), the DSRC-equipped vehicles present on both sides of the road will participate in hopping to maximize the number of available hopping nodes in situations with lighter traffic flow or low DSRC market penetration. Furthermore, the hopping algorithm increases message security by not requiring the hopping nodes (i.e., the DSRC-equipped vehicles) to modify the contents of the hopped message. Numerical simulations have been performed to evaluate the performance of the hopping algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed hopping algorithm works as expected and successfully disseminates DSRC messages along a predefined route.

AB We present a method to monitor driver distraction based on a stereo camera to estimate the face pose and gaze of a driver in real time. A coarse eye direction is composed of face pose estimation to obtain the gaze and driver's fixation area in the scene, which is a parameter that gives much information about the distraction pattern of the driver. The system does not require any subject-specific calibration; it is robust to fast and wide head rotations and works under low-lighting conditions. The system provides some consistent statistics, which help psychologists to assess the driver distraction patterns under influence of different in-vehicle information systems (IVISs). These statistics are objective, as the drivers are not required to report their own distraction states. The proposed gaze fixation system has been tested on a set of challenging driving experiments directed by a team of psychologists in a naturalistic driving simulator. This simulator mimics conditions present in real driving, including weather changes, maneuvering, and distractions due to IVISs. Professional drivers participated in the tests.

TI Urban expressway-arterial corridor on-line control system based an
   advanced traveler information system
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB A novel on-line dynamic traffic control strategy for an urban expressway-arterial corridor system is proposed. The corridor system comprises an expressway mainline, on and off-ramps, and surface streets (arterial roads). The ramps are not subjected to any ramp metering control. Assuming that the real-time vehicle arrival and departure can be obtained from the loop detectors on the expressway, the proposed traffic control strategy aims to maintain a predetermined level of service on a congested expressway section by disseminating the congestion information to drivers through various advanced traveler information system means. This strategy consists of three components: expressway mainline control (EMC), on-ramp control (OnC), and off-ramp control (OffC) mechanisms. The EMC mechanism is the major component that diverts vehicles from the expressway to the surface streets, and the OnC and OffC procedures protect the ramps and surface streets from excessive flow. This is because diverting the vehicles without taking into consideration the surface street capacity may cause the overall performance of the corridor system to deteriorate. A simulation-based modeling methodology is developed to evaluate the on-line dynamic traffic control strategy. The evaluation is carried out by performing sensitivity analysis tests of the control parameters used in the strategy. A case study based on a corridor system in Singapore has shown that the traffic control strategy is effective.

TI Improved Identification and Calculation of Horizontal Curves with
   Geographic Information System Road Layers
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Horizontal curve data are collected or calculated by transportation agencies for different purposes because there is always a demand to generate new curve data either to improve the data quality or to extend the data coverage. There are different approaches and technologies for curve data collection. The selection of methods takes into consideration accuracy, cost, and available sources. There is, consequently, a wide interest in extracting curve information from available road network data of the geographic information system (GIS). When the cost of GIS data extraction is much lower than the cost of other approaches, it is significant to improve the accuracy of GIS curve identification and calculation. This paper analyzes errors related to existing GIS curve calculation methods and introduces a new method to identify and to calculate horizontal curves with improved accuracy. The new method uses regression analysis of road vertex direction-location profiles to calculate curve radii. A freeway segment on Interstate 80 in Nevada, including the eastbound and westbound directions, was selected to evaluate the accuracy of the new method. The evaluation compared the curve calculation results and the accurate curve information from project contract plans. The evaluation results proved the effect of the new procedure on improving the accuracy of horizontal curve identification and estimation. The new method can be implemented as a GIS tool to scan GIS road networks automatically and create horizontal curve data layers. This new method can also be used to generate curve data from GPS survey data.

AB Travel time estimation is important for a wide range of applications, including advanced traveler information systems (ATIS), sustainability analysis, and discrete choice modeling. Approaches to travel time estimation traditionally have been based on aggregate data sets that examine travel times over a number of days or travel times in previous time intervals. Automatic vehicle identification data make it possible to analyze travel time data at a totally disaggregate or individual commuter level. It is postulated in this research that the capability of modeling travel characteristics on a disaggregate level can improve the accuracy with which performance measures are quantified. The test beds examined are a 22-km section of the I-10 corridor and a 21-km section of the US-290 corridor in Houston, Texas. It was found that aggregation across days, which does not consider the effect of individual days, is 63 percent less accurate than aggregation by days, which does consider the effect of individual days. Even though the latter technique was found to be more accurate, it was illustrated that 40 percent of the regular commuters' travel times are statistically different from these aggregate estimates. Similarly, for travel time variability, it was found that for approximately 20 percent of the cases the travel time standard deviations for regular commuters are statistically different from the aggregate estimates. These results illustrate the uniqueness of an individual commuter's travel patterns and emphasize the benefit of conducting analyses at the level of the individual commuter for both ATIS and sustainable transportation.

AB In response to an initiative to develop an advanced traffic information system in Bangkok, this paper explores practical guidelines for the optimal location of road sensors, such that the data collected on spot speeds reflect an entire link's average speed. In particular, the authors use microsimulation software to investigate optimal detector locations, using the sum of squared errors and root mean squared errors. The analysis hypothesizes that road segments are 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 km in length and are specially designed to replicate typical arterial streets in Bangkok. The results show that a single detector location can produce good estimates of link speed only for segments that are shorter than 1.0 km. For distances of 1.0 km or more, the results suggest that two detectors be used for good link speed estimates under all traffic conditions.

DE Navigation system; optimal control; quality measure; real-time traffic
   information; variable speed limit system
AB Advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) present traffic information to travelers to assist them in planning their journeys and also provide guidance when on the road. Providing travelers with information affects travel behavior and can result in improved performance and reduced congestion and emissions. However, the success of ATIS depends on, among other factors, whether drivers consider it useful and their particular responses to the provided information. There are, currently, many sources and market players in the traffic information industry producing traffic reports for consumers. The main objective of this paper was to examine whether traffic information provided from different sources are consistent with one other. A variable speed limit system and real-time traffic information system for in-vehicle navigation systems are used as a case study. This comparative analysis was made by superimposing the space-time regions of ground truth measured traffic conditions ("reality") over the space-time regions of the reported information broadcasts. A predictive buffer was also introduced in the assessment. The predictive buffer was included to account for traffic information which could be considered as advance warning messages or correctly predicting and giving congestion information prior to the onset of actual congestion, which otherwise may have been reported as false alarms. This was motivated by the fact that optimal control approaches include the prediction of congestion in their control strategies. The methods developed in this research work have been applied to a real world problem to prove its applicability.

AB West Virginia University, under contract to the Federal Transit Administration, has developed two tools to evaluate the pollutant emissions, greenhouse gases, and fuel economy of transit buses: a searchable database of transit vehicle emission data and a transit fleet emission inventory model. These tools, complemented by a transit vehicle life-cycle cost model developed by West Virginia University, Battelle, and Transit Resource Center for the Transportation Research Board, provide an interactive, approachable, and reliable method for users, primarily transit agencies, to evaluate overall fleet emissions and fuel consumption for optimization of fleet configuration and operation. These tools will be made available through an online website called the Integrated Bus Information System (IBIS). This paper describes development of the transit fleet inventory model and comparison with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) MOBILE6 and MOVES (motor vehicle emission simulator) emission inventory models. The IBIS model was developed from extensive chassis dynamometer data from several reference vehicles. Polynomial models were built through linear regression. These backbone models characterized the effects of driving activity on vehicle emissions and fuel consumption. Comparison of predicted emissions showed good agreement for hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen emissions and acceptable agreement for particulate matter emissions. The EPA MOBILE6 model assumed constant values as a function of duty cycle for carbon dioxide emissions and fuel economy. The West Virginia University IBIS model and EPA MOVES model displayed similar trends for carbon dioxide emissions, but MOVES predicted substantially lower carbon dioxide levels.

AB Pavement performance models exist in various forms to cater to the pavement management agencies' needs and resources. Well-calibrated models are needed to accurately predict future pavement conditions and to forecast and prioritize confidently the future rehabilitation and maintenance expenditures. Statistical tools are commonly used to develop the performance models. These statistical models may be impractical or misleading if they do not consider experts' opinions. This paper presents a hybrid technique where statistical tools and expert knowledge are combined for the calibration of pavement performance models. This technique was validated using historical pavement condition data for continuously reinforced concrete pavements (CRCP) from the Texas Department of Transportation's pavement management information system (TxDOT-PMIS). The recalibrated CRCP performance models obtained with the hybrid technique represent an improvement when compared to the current models since they merge expert opinion and statistical analysis, which better reflect field observations regarding distress initiation, distress evolution rate, and maximum allowable amount of distress growth.

AB The paper proposed a Personalize Parking Guidance Service(PPGS), in which a bi-level programming model was built to describe the relationship between the Personalized Parking Guidance Information System and drivers. The upper-level of the model aimed to achieve the efficetive and balanced utilization of parking resonurces during peak time, while the lower-level model was to minimize the driver's walking distance after parking.A nested Particel Swarm Optimization algorithm was used to solve the proposed model. The simulation results of the model show that the peak congestion time has been reduced remarkably under the guidance of the proposed model. The Mean value of Unocuupied Parking Difference Index(MUPDI) curves trend to decline during the overall process. It means that within the acceptable walking distance, the proposed parking lots allocation model can effectively balance the utilization of parking resources shared in the service area and minimize walking distance as well.

We describe the approaches and formulations used at BNSF and CSX, comparing them to other published articles on implemented Equipment Distribution Optimization systems. We concentrate on the similarities and differences in the approaches and challenges of system implementation. Finally, we discuss how the choice of optimization model technology must complement railroad organizational structure, information systems, decision making processes and operational procedures.

AB The development of procedures for creating bus route information is discussed as part of a Global Positioning System (GPS)-based bus inventory database in urban transit systems for intelligent transportation system applications. In the past, bus route information was usually entered into the database through geographic information system tools. Procedures involved in data entry were often very tedious. This study utilizes GPS technology to automate the process of generating data inventory for bus route information. An efficient algorithm was developed in this study for capturing the route information on the basis of a sequence of vehicle location data. The algorithm can be readily implemented with computer programs. The route information obtained from the algorithm is compared with the field bus trajectory data collected in Blacksburg, Virginia. In particular, comparison was made for different digitizing intervals and different bus routes. The results show that the route map created is sufficiently accurate for many applications. The route map information obtained from this study is particularly useful for the development of transit information systems to (a) predict arrival time of the next bus and (b) track schedule adherence of individual buses.

AB The primary purpose of this study was to better understand US travelers' route guidance information preferences for Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) for tourist automobile trips in unfamiliar areas. A secondary purpose was to better understand, more generally, information needs and preferences of tourists in order to develop guidelines for designing ATIS that is specific for driving tourists. Data on information needs and preferences were collected through a mail-back questionnaire survey of US adult residents. Among other topics, the questionnaire asked respondents about their preferences for various types of route guidance information. These data are reported here. Survey respondents gave positive ratings to all nine types of route guidance information investigated in the study, including selecting best route to destination, travel routes shown on map, road conditions, traffic congestion on route, presence of construction, weather conditions, time or distance on route, options/recommendations for alternate routes, and identification of scenic byways. Differences in preferences by sex, age, education, and income are discussed and guidelines for ATIS development, specific to route guidance, are presented.

TI Prototype Information System for Estimating Average Vehicle Occupancies
   from Traffic Accident Records
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Vehicle occupancy data are increasingly being used to assess and monitor congestion management strategies. They are traditionally collected in the field with the roadside windshield method and the carousel method. Although these traditional methods have the benefit of collecting up-to-date data and can be tailored to specific application needs, they are also much more costly to conduct, especially when repeated data collection is needed for monitoring purposes. An alternative to these traditional methods is to estimate average vehicle occupancies (AVOs) from vehicle occupancy information recorded in existing traffic accident records. This method is cost-effective because it involves no new data collection, and it can provide better spatial and temporal coverage. However, this method is also known to be affected by potential biases resulting from underand overinvolvement of certain population sectors in traffic accidents. Also, for corridor studies, the number of accident records available may not meet the minimum required sample size for the desired accuracy. An effort was made to develop a prototype information system that can make use of vehicle occupancy information in accident data to estimate AVOs. The system was designed to account for driver's age and driver's gender biases. The system also includes a number of variables that can be used for spatial and temporal AVO monitoring, including district, county, hour, week, month, year, vehicle type, facility type, area type, and crash severity. A reasonableness check of the results from the system shows AVO estimates that are highly consistent with expectations.

AB Social optimization emerged as a strategy for the attainment of more efficient road traffic (i.e., minimal total or average travel time). In order to achieve efficiency benefits, collective action is needed. A major challenge is that not every individual benefits equally from social optimization. Thus, a corresponding technological implementation (i.e., a social optimizing traveler information system (SOTIS)) is prone to rejection. The question remains as to which factors underlie the acceptance of such a system. Therefore a sample of 391 car drivers in Germany, stratified by kilometers driven per year, age and gender, completed a scenario-based questionnaire addressing attitudinal acceptance of a SOTIS.
   The results indicate that participants reacted rather hesitantly towards incorporating a SOTIS into daily driving. Indeed, structural equation modeling revealed that the behavioral intention to use it was promoted by its perceived usefulness. However, this intention was negatively affected by elicited subjective ambivalence (i.e., simultaneous conducive and opposing affect towards the SOTIS). Opposition in subjective ambivalence could be explained by perceived injustice. Social factors (i.e., a social norm and image gains due to using the system) were positively associated with perceived usefulness. The high social dependency and the effect for perceived injustice were not replicated in a second sample of 111 drivers that evaluated a user-optimizing traveler information system (UOTIS).
   The results suggest to taking active ambivalence reduction through transparent prevention of injustice, and the promotion of a conducive social norm into account in the planning and design of a SOTIS. Additionally, this study provides an empirically tested framework for examining the emergence and maintenance of acceptance of such a system.

TI Technological and Human Factor Considerations for Priced Managed Lane
   Traveler Information Systems
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Travelers have many unique informational requirements to be able to navigate priced managed lanes. These demands often relate to specific managed lane features (e.g., access points, toll price) in addition to information about major traffic incidents and lane closures. Accommodating these needs with traditional roadway signage is a particular challenge given concerns about overloading and distracting drivers. This paper summarizes an investigation into traveler information systems for managed lanes, by considering a national review of current agency practices, a traveler survey, and an assessment for integrating advancing technologies. The national review found that many agencies vary considerably in pricing structure, number, and placement of priced destination points, and online availability of real-time toll information. A travel survey of 866 Texas-based respondents indicated that drivers prioritize information about traffic incidents and lane closures over toll price data (94% and 88% versus 41%, respectively). A higher share of respondents wanted to see travel time and incident alerts on in-vehicle devices, compared with a more statistically significant desire for destination and toll rate information on roadway signs. Most respondents use smartphone applications and mapping websites for pre-trip planning purposes (79% and 65%, respectively) compared with TV and radio reports (13%). Comparatively, prior research published 5 years earlier found that radio was a highly influential media in influencing behavior. This paper suggests a pathway for agencies to adopt a flexible approach for sharing essential data with third-party entities, based on the general transit-feed specification used for transit.

AB Increasing the share of multimodal journeys is becoming more and more urgent in our society in order to guarantee a high level of mobility in the long term. While car drivers are already assisted by advanced guidance and navigation facilities, continuous on-trip assistance for multimodal travelers is still in its infancy. Especially when it comes to situations of modal change, travelers get discouraged by the increased complexity and the lack of adequate information and guidance. Thus, the goal of our research over the past three years has been to integrate existing information systems and to design and implement the prototype of a digital personal travel companion for multimodal travelers. This paper discusses typical travel situations and possible, barriers for people traveling on multimodal journeys. To address these challenges, functional requirements for a personal travel companion are derived from the analysis of the situations. The main sections of this paper describe our results focusing on personalized multimodal journey planning, mobile multimodal trip management, and smart-phone-based pedestrian orientation and guidance in complex public transport transfer buildings.

TI Benefits of Geographic Information Systems in Managing a Major
   Transportation Program Evaluation and Lessons Learned
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents the use of geographic information systems (GIS) in the support of a major state transportation program and discusses the lessons learned on the improvement of future results. The review is based on the results of a benefit cost (BC) analysis that showed overall positive returns as well as areas in which effectiveness could be improved. In 2004, the Oregon Department of Transportation (DOT) contracted with the Oregon Bridge Delivery Partners (OBDP) to manage a $1.3 billion bridge repair and reconstruction program known as the Oregon Transportation Investment Act III State Bridge Delivery Program. GIS was integral to the information strategy deployed in the management of the program. In 2010, in a review of the GIS and other information technology systems, the Oregon DOT and OBDP jointly conducted a BC analysis of the impact of these systems on the bridge program. The agencies found a positive rate of return, generally, for all information technology systems and for GIS systems taken as a group. For maximum benefit from these systems to be achieved in support of major programs, the agencies found the following factors important to consider: timing, flexibility, compatibility with other system architecture, integration with the standards of project owners and contractors, and compatibility with contract and legal obligations. Although the technology itself had proved successful, the program showed that an integrated strategy was essential to realize the maximum potential value of GIS.

TI Aging Population-Focused Accessibility Assessment of Multimodal

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID RELATIVE SPATIAL EQUITY; SPATIOTEMPORAL ACCESSIBILITY; FREIGHT
   TRANSPORTATION
AB A significant responsibility of officials involved in transportation planning is ensuring people's accessibility to multimodal facilities. This challenging task depends on the available transportation infrastructure as well as the overall population, traffic, roadway, and regional characteristics. Such planning takes on additional complexity when aging populations are considered because any extra time that they incur in reaching these facilities can be especially confounding in light of their potential health and other safety concerns. As such, there is a need for transportation plans to have a multimodal transportation assessment component that specifically focuses on the accessibility of aging people to critical facilities. To accomplish this goal, this paper describes a geographic information systems-based methodology for measuring the aging population-focused accessibility to multimodal facilities in Florida. Spatially detailed population block- and county-based accessibility scores are calculated with respect to key intermodal facility types (airports, bus stations, and railway and ferry stations) and visually assessed by geographic information system maps. The knowledge obtained from this accessibility analysis can successfully contribute to the development of more reliable aging population focused multimodal transportation plans, as the analysis points to specific areas where accessibility could be improved.

AB Advances in geographic information system (GIS) software and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) techniques give transportation safety engineers tools to observe and analyze safety-related data from a new perspective. This research takes the use of GIS software and ESDA techniques one step further by incorporating advanced statistical techniques for a more thorough and complex analysis of safety data. This is achieved by implementing a network-constrained cross K-function to analyze the relationship between bridges and the occurrences of ice-related crashes within a county. The counties in Wisconsin included in the analysis were selected through the use of the local Moran's I statistic; this statistic allows for the selection of counties within the same geographical area, which have similar parameters (in this case, ice-related crash rates). The objective of this research is to explore the relationship between ice-related crashes and bridges in counties that display similar ice-related crash rates, to compare and analyze winter maintenance techniques. The results identify clustering of ice-related crashes around bridges in four counties with similar ice-related crash rates in southeast Wisconsin. Similarly, two of four counties show clustering of ice-related crashes around bridges in northwest Wisconsin. These results make a strong case to suggest that counties in these regions should focus additional winter maintenance efforts at bridge locations. In addition, this research shows how the use of advanced spatial statistical techniques, particularly network-based statistics applied within a GIS environment, can be used as a unique and innovative approach toward safety data analysis.

AB The information about the environment and the precise guidance of visually impaired people is the basis for their safe movement of the traffic network. Therefore, the information and communication services should be adapted to this group of users. The services based on the advanced information and communication technologies provide the visually impaired persons with information about the environment while moving along the traffic network. This paper analyses the currently available information systems of users when moving traffic network, and the currently most services based on new ICT (Information and Communications Technology). The analysis was carried on a representative sample of the City of Zagreb (Croatia) in involving all interest groups of visually impaired people. Based on defined user requirements is proposed a new services based on NFC (Near Field Communication) and RTLS (Real-Time Locating Systems). Testing and analysing the efficiency of single information and communication technologies have been performed on the actual traffic network system of the City of Zagreb. The users of the Croatian Society for Promotion and Development of Tiphlotechnology (Hrvatska Udruga za Promicanje i Razvoj Tiflotehnike - HUPRT, http://www.huprt.hr) participated in checking the efficiency of single technologies and services.

AB An in-depth investigation of the costs and benefits of geographic information system (GIS) implementation in the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) is presented. The investigation addresses a critical need to determine the organizational impact and cost-effectiveness of this enterprisewide information technology to achieve the greatest benefit IDOT conducted an enterprisewide effort to portray GIS capabilities and to identify candidate GIS projects. Fourteen major GIS projects were selected on the basis of management priority, ease of implementation, and user commitment. A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis was developed over fiscal years 1995 through 2004. Costs were reasonably estimated from historical costs of the GIS investigation effort and future costs of GIS technical support and user area resources. The greatest portions of costs, over the 10-year time frame, were for personnel (67 percent) and consultant services (19 percent). For the more difficult benefits determination, the research employed two categories of benefits: efficiency and effectiveness. Efficiency benefits would result from the automation of previous manual efforts, such as special-purpose cartographic production, with GIS outputs. Effectiveness benefits arise from traditionally intangible areas, such as increased integration and accessibility of information for improved decision making. Effectiveness benefits were estimated conservatively for two high-priority areas: accident analysis and program development The result of the cost-benefit analysis of GIS implementation yielded a net present value of $2.9 million and an internal rate of return of 99.8 percent over the analysis period. This provided IDOT management with knowledge for strategic resource allocation decisions.

AB A microsimulation method is presented for evaluating the effectiveness of potential intelligent transportation system (ITS) strategies under non-recurrent congestion. The evaluated ITS strategies include incident management, adaptive ramp metering, traveler information systems, arterial management, and a combination of those strategies. These strategies are implemented and evaluated over a road network in Irvine, California, with the microsimulation model PARAMICS. The evaluation results show that all ITS strategies have positive effects on network performance. Because of the network topology (one major freeway with two parallel arterial streets), real-time traveler information has the greatest benefits among all single ITS strategies. However, a combination of ITS strategies can further increase benefits.

AB In making a decision to redesign a cramped or inefficient maintenance facility within a built urban environment, the cost of relocation must consider the change in operating costs due to rerouting transit routes and potentially changed deadhead costs (i.e., those costs associated with the trip a bus vehicle takes between the maintenance base and the start or end of a route). A sketch-level method for estimating bus deadhead costs that can serve as an input to high-level decision-making processes is described. In a recent analysis for TransLink in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, this methodology helped to quantify the total net change in deadhead costs associated with various location options. A geographic information systems (GIS) tool was used to calculate the shortest path among alternative maintenance base locations and start and end points of bus routes. Shortest-path calculations were based on estimated travel speeds, congestion, and known geographic constraints provided by the operator. Total deadhead-related costs were then estimated for each of the three maintenance base location options under consideration. The difference between these costs served as one component in the decision-making process, along with other factors such as property acquisition and construction cost. This analysis serves as an example of how GIS use can provide a low-cost sketch-planning tool to inform investment decisions.

AB Accessibility is increasingly identified in the academic literature and in planning practice as a key criterion to assess transport policies and urban land use development. This paper contributes in two respects to the growing body of literature on accessibility and accessibility measurement. First, it proposes a set of accessibility measures that directly relates transit-based and car-based accessibility to each other. Second, it presents a tool based on a geographic information system (GIS) that measures accessibility at a high level of resolution. The tool, called Urban.Access, has been developed as an ArcGIS extension and can be used in urban regions worldwide, provided high-resolution GIS data are available. Urban.Access enables a detailed representation of travel times by transit and car and thus makes it possible to adequately compare accessibility levels by transport mode. The first application of Urban.Access to the Tel Aviv, Israel, region shows substantial gaps between car-based and transit-based accessibility throughout the metropolitan area. The paper ends with a brief discussion highlighting the policy consequences of this finding.

AB A method of combining two information bases with the aid of geographic information systems to identify locations where pedestrian crash problems exist or may exist in the near future is described. The first information base is a set of police crash reports. Locations and attributes obtained from these reports are used to identify clusters of pedestrian crashes in an area so that sites can be evaluated for safety improvements. Geographic analysis of crash types, severity, pedestrian age, and other factors may also be conducted with these data. The second information base is a set of pedestrian and driver perception surveys. Data from this survey are used to identify locations that may have a high potential for crashes even though none or few have been reported recently. Integrating the two information bases may allow transportation planners and engineers to focus on sites with the greatest potential for pedestrian improvements and ultimately prevent more crashes, injuries, and fatalities. The proactive data integration technique developed in this study was applied to pedestrian safety problems on a college campus, aiding the process of planning and implementing various countermeasures related to education, enforcement, and engineering. Note that more than 17 million people (more than 6 percent of the population) in the United States are associated with college campuses. The method can also be applied to bicycle or other special types of crashes in other geographic areas such as cities, commercial zones, and neighborhoods.

AB The final prototype of a centralized voice information system, developed under the framework of the European CeMVocAS (Centralised Management of Vocal Interfaces Aiming at a Better Automotive Safety) project, was evaluated. This system manages all types of voice messages to the driver (i.e., input and output voice flows to and from car telephone, radio, and driver assistance systems) to minimize their disruptive impact on the basic task of driving. Analysis of the results included evaluation of (a) the part of the system responsible for determining the driver's potential availability to receive voice messages [driving situation recognition unit (DSRU)] and (b) the complete system (DSRU plus centralized voice interface management system). Results indicate that the system is quite robust in terms of vehicle, driver, and route variability; in addition, levels of system effectiveness, system efficiency, and user satisfaction were high.

AB Performance of transit agencies in the United States improved during the 1980s. At the beginning of the decade, Americans had become disenchanted with transit; legislation was passed that required agencies to report performance and accept regular audits. Theory underlying these policies is examined in four components: dimensions for policy objectives, indicators, information systems and incentives. Three programs are examined: federal triennial reviews that monitor compliance with planning and grant requirements, California performance audits that analyze goals and track performance on five indicators and the Los Angeles program that encourages improvement by offering incentive payments for better-than-average performance. The California audits have been the most successful.

AB This paper discusses the approach, results, and keys to success in using new mobile geographic information system (GIS) technology in a public involvement context to assess the transportation infrastructure of most relevance to livable and healthy communities. Research on active transportation and the built environment is a fairly recent area of inquiry, accelerated over the past 10 years by an increased interest in the relationship between urban form and public health. As the research has progressed, so has the interest in developing ways to collect data at a fine scale-the streetscape level-and link these data to transportation behavior. This paper discusses the development and implementation of two mobile GIS-based tools that communities can use or adapt for quick, georeferenced, and useful local area analysis; one tool focuses on safe routes to school and the other on more complete local street networks. The public involvement component can help to create a political coalition that becomes active in translating data into political or technical action by appropriate public departments. Both tools were developed specifically to include a general, nontechnical public in the data-gathering and data analysis processes and have been tested in a variety of communities across the country. This paper summarizes both tools and some results from their use in different settings. It also discusses how the tools can be used in research investigating the relationship between the layperson's subjective perception of pedestrian and bicycle environments and objective design variables.

TI Applications of Geographic Information System in Airfield Infrastructure
   System Management and Maintenance
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB New geographic information system (GIS) applications in airfield infrastructure system management and maintenance are discussed. Aviation activity is steadily increasing, and U.S. airport facilities must provide higher service quality and must increase capacities to accommodate projected aviation growth. In response to the increasing requirements from passengers and airliners, efficiency is the most important factor in airport operations and airfield facilities maintenance. Airport authorities, particularly at large commercial airports, increasingly understand the benefits in using GIS-based programs to plan and manage their airport facilities. An integrated GIS system combined with Geographic Positioning Systems and personal digital assistants provides a powerful tool that helps airport operators and engineers improve regular airfield inspection, management, and reporting processes, resulting in a more efficient airport operation system. GIS applications associated with other tools are introduced, and airport personnel are given several easy-to-learn GIS approaches and techniques. This is intended to help airports improve current airfield facility inspection processes and maintenance mechanisms. An implementation plan achieved at Kaohsiung International Airport in Taiwan was used to demonstrate how an integrated GIS system can help airport operators and engineers receive real-time facilities data, evaluate deterioration rates, and make policy decisions on maintenance and rehabilitation within a short time. This implementation plan is designed on a step-by-step basis that allows airport personnel to easily follow and apply the system to airport practice. Another example carried out at Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC) in Utah was used to show GIS applications in facilitating skid resistance evaluation of runway surfaces. By adding projection data to the airport image, SLC airport maintenance crews can graphically evaluate friction capacities of Runway 16L-34R and investigate potential factors that result in a reduction of skid resistance. Up-to-date GIS application approaches are shown so that airport personnel may develop a suitable GIS system that enables airports to improve their operation systems and increase aviation safety.

TI A PARKING MODEL HIERARCHY
SO TRANSPORTATION

DT Article
DE INFORMATION SYSTEMS; MICROCOMPUTER MODELS; PARKING SYSTEM DESIGN
AB The last decade has seen considerable developments in computer assisted design procedures which enable planners to investigate the impacts of changes in the transport system.  These developments have become more available to analysts through the introduction of microcomputers and computer graphics.  Unfortunately, the impacts of parking on the transport have not been incorporated explicitly in many of thes models since their prime concern is the movement of traffic.  Parking system design and policy analysis can, however, benefit greatly from these developments in computer technology and availability.  The design of parking systems can be improved and the investigation of policy impacts can be trialed or refined prior to their introduction using microcomputer packages.  This paper outlines some developments in these areas.  More specifically, it outlines a hierarchy or microcomputer models and information systems that can investigate parking policy and study the "level of service" provided by parking systems.

AB Geographic information systems, global positioning systems, traffic flow sensors and cellular phones are sources of real-time traffic data in road networks. However, many vehicle routing algorithms do not account for this real-time information. In this paper, we consider the problem of adjusting in real-time a time-dependent delivery plan to respond to dynamic changes in travel times. We also consider a variant of the problem in which some customer requests can be canceled. The goal is to minimize disruption by maintaining as much as possible the current planned routes, although without compromising too much solution quality. Computational results obtained by solving instances with up to 500 customers are reported and compared with a strategy that maintains the planned routes, whatever the cost.

This study models the dynamic flow propagation of multiple units of information using a multi-layer framework that captures the dynamics of the three interacting layers: physical traffic flow, inter-vehicle communication, and information flow. The traffic flow dynamics are captured using a cell transmission model in the physical traffic flow layer. The inter-vehicle communication layer uses the time-dependent locations of vehicles in the traffic flow layer and inter-vehicle communication-related constraints to determine the occurrences of inter-vehicle communication. The information flow layer depicts the flow of multiple units of information as a network. Thereby, the proposed framework describes how the dynamic flow propagation of multiple units of information can be mapped from the traffic flow dynamics and the inter-vehicle communication constraints. Synthetic experiments analyze the interactions between the traffic flow dynamics and inter-vehicle communication constraints, and the flow propagation characteristics of multiple units of information. They illustrate that the proposed multi-layer framework enables the integration of the traffic flow dynamics and inter-vehicle communication constraints to generate insights into the flow propagation of multiple units of information. Also, they indicate that it can be extended to incorporate the dynamic flow propagation characteristics of multiple units of information into the design of robust V2V-based ATIS architectures.

AB The purpose of this article is to question the presumption that route guidance and information systems necessarily reduce traffic congestion, and to point out the need to consider the general equilibrium effects of information.  A simple model of the morning rush hour is adopted in which commuters choose a departure time and one of two routes to work, the capacities of which are stochastic.  While expected travel costs are reduced by perfectly informing all drivers about route capacities, this is not necessarily the case if imperfect information is provided.  A heuristic explanation is that, absent tolls, congestion is an uninternalized externality.  Information can cause drivers to change their departure times in such a way as to exacerbate congestion.

TI Vehicle-to-Infrastructure and Vehicle-to-Vehicle Information System in

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

ID DSRC
AB This paper describes the architecture, functionality, and field demonstration results of a newly developed dedicated short-range communication based vehicle-to-infrastructure work zone traffic information system with vehicle-to-vehicle assistance. The new system is portable and can automatically acquire important work zone travel information such as the travel time and the starting location of congestion and then relay this information to drivers approaching the congestion site. Such information can help drivers make informed decisions on route choice, prepare for upcoming congestion, or both. The authors had designed a similar system earlier; that system had limited congestion coverage and message broadcast ranges, but the new system can achieve a much longer broadcast range (up to a few tens of kilometers) and can handle much longer congestion coverage (up to a few kilometers) by incorporating vehicle-to-infrastructure communication assisted by vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The system requires only a single roadside unit to acquire traffic data by engaging the vehicles traveling on the road whether within or outside of its direct wireless access range. From the traffic data, the system estimates important traffic parameters such as travel time and starting location of congestion and periodically broadcasts this information back to the vehicles approaching the congestion well before they enter the congested area. The results from the field demonstration show that the new system can adapt to a dynamically changing work zone traffic environment and can handle much longer congestion lengths as compared with the previous system, which used only vehicle-to-infrastructure communication without vehicle-to-vehicle assistance.

AB The environmental disburdening by means of outsourcing logistics (sorting, bundling, transport) is today significantly more present, since this has been regulated by the law provisions on environmental protection and the economic reasons. Outsourcing logistics in this field with its activities such as: improvement in assembling separate fraction, introduction of new, i.e. additional boxes, usage of specific vehicles for collection and dispatch, reestablishment of information systems and organization of a centre for disburdening of the environment (sorting, bundling and waste disposal) is contributing largely to a better accomplishment of the mission of logistics rationalization and adaptation to new law claims on environmental protection.

AB This study presents a warning information system based on an innovate methodology to estimate accident likelihood in real time. Bayesian modeling approach implemented by the probabilistic neural network (PNN) is conducted to identify hazardous traffic conditions leading to potential accident occurrence. The proposed system displays warning signs to call drivers' attention for safer and careful driving once hazardous traffic conditions are observed by evaluating accident likelihood. It is believed that the proposed system to produce effective warning information for real-time safety enhancement could be a valuable tool to highway users and operators.

AB The main objective of this paper is to establish the procedures necessary to the development of a model for the environmental risk assessment of accidents involving Transporting Hazardous Materials by Road (THMR). Quantifying the environmental risk is useful in identifying areas with a high risk of accidents, which can be later discarded as main routes; orienting efficient emergency response operations; and assessing policies aimed at reducing these risks. Taking this into consideration, this study endeavors to identify the methodological aspects make possible the assessment of the impacts that arise from accidents involving the transportation of hazardous materials by road and to implement such methodological aspects in a Geographic Information System (GIS).

TI Climate Change Effects on Transportation Infrastructure Scenario-Based
   Risk Analysis Using Geographic Information Systems
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID VULNERABILITY
AB The potential effects of climate change on transportation infrastructure have been receiving attention in recent years. An especially useful and increasingly common approach to investigating the potential effects of climate change on infrastructure is the use of geographic information systems (GISs) for risk analysis because climate change effects are likely to occur in conjunction with other geographically specific impacts such as storm surge and traffic operations, whose vulnerability can be most effectively quantified with GIS-based tools. To demonstrate the efficacy of these tools, a scenario-based risk analysis approach is presented: it investigates the effects of climate change on transportation infrastructure in Hampton Roads, Virginia. First, climate change effects in the study site are investigated to develop representative climate change scenarios. Then, a GIS-based evaluation of transportation infrastructure vulnerability to sea level rise and storm surge is formed by combining the GIS data set with results from the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. Finally, the proposed risk model generates a GIS-based risk map under three scenarios of climate change threat. Results indicate that the city of Virginia Beach, Virginia, is at high risk in all three scenarios because of climate change events, a high level of transportation activity, and density of transportation facilities. The risk map a visualization of the risk model can assist transportation planners and decision makers with prioritizing assets to allocate resources for emergency preparation and response.

TI Highway alignment optimization incorporating bridges and tunnels

ID MODEL
AB A three-dimensional highway alignment optimization methodology is developed that automatically determines whether and where bridges or tunnels are preferable to embankments or deep cuts, respectively. This is done by comparing the optimized costs of such alternatives. The data for detailed computations of earthwork, right-of-way, vehicle operation, user time, and other costs are obtained from a geographic information system (GIS) for each alternative alignment considered. The alignment optimization process relies on a genetic algorithm developed for this problem. Two example studies implemented in an artificial study area with a real GIS show that by modeling bridges and tunnels we can improve the reliability and adaptability of highway alignment optimization as well as find more practical solutions than otherwise.

TI Evaluating highway capacity investments using a geographic information
   systems-based tool - Trip-based full marginal cost approach
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents an interactive computer tool based on geographic information systems (GIS) and developed for the evaluation and analysis of full marginal costs (FMC) of highway transportation in New Jersey. The first part of the paper is concerned with the implementation of a trip-based FMC estimation methodology in the GIS environment. A constrained k-shortest-path algorithm is proposed to estimate the trip-based FMC of a trip along not only the shortest travel time path but also a set of feasible paths between each origin-destination (O-D) pair that can be attractive to the travelers. The second part of the paper deals with estimation of various transportation cost categories, including vehicle operation, congestion, accident, air pollution, noise, and maintenance. This estimation uses New Jersey-specific data. The methodology is then implemented in ArcGIS, with the use of Visual Basic and C-programming language. The developed GIS-based tool not only estimates FMC between a selected O-D pair but also compares complete and partial networks to assess short-term impacts of infrastructure investments on the FMC. The proposed tool will help planners to calculate true trip costs between different O-D pairs for various user-defined scenarios of various demand and supply changes.

AB This paper aims to develop a decision-making tool that can be used by government agencies in planning for flood emergency logistics. In this article, the flood emergency logistics problem with uncertainty is formulated as two stochastic programming models that allow for the determination of a rescue resource distribution system for urban flood disasters. The decision variables include the structure of rescue organizations, locations of rescue resource storehouses, allocations of rescue resources under capacity restrictions, and distributions of rescue resources. By applying the data processing and network analysis functions of the geographic information system, flooding potential maps can estimate the possible locations of rescue demand points and the required amount of rescue equipment. The proposed models are solved using a sample average approximation scheme. Finally, a real example of planning for flood emergency logistics is presented to highlight the significance of the proposed model as well as the efficacy of the proposed solution strategy.

DE Geographic Information System (GIS); transportation; modelling;

AB Geographic Information System (GIS) is an ''intelligent'' technology which integrates attribute data and spatial features and manages the relationship between them. GIS is widely used in many activities, but its application in transportation is less common. The extension of GIS into transportation (GIS-T) offers the potential to integrate transportation data into GIS. The integration of transportation data in GIS faces a number of barriers that are discussed in the paper. These barriers can be broadly categorized into data attribution and network representation issues. This paper analyzes these issues and reviews the potential for overcoming these constraints with current GIS technology. A fully developed GIS-T has to meet many diverse needs including transportation inventory, modeling and operational problems. If GIS is to succeed as a transportation technology, it must be capable of integrating different levels of network representation and data attribution and have the ability to link with other transportation technologies.

ID DECISION
AB This paper provides a theoretical analysis of advanced traveler information systems for road choice with risk-averse drivers who rationally learn over time, in a simple setting. For this purpose, we study the one-armed bandit problem where a driver selects, day after day, either a safe or a random road. Four information regimes. are envisaged. The visionary driver knows beforehand, with certainty, the travel time on the random road, while the locally informed driver needs to select a road to acquire information on it. Two intermediary information regimes (fully and globally) are also envisaged. We analyze these four regimes and compare the optimal strategies and the individual benefits with respect to individual risk aversion. A numerical example also illustrates the impact of risk aversion on dynamic optimal strategies.

AB Among the main factors affecting road crash injuries, speed is considered as a leading cause and contributing factor. There are numerous studies linking travel speeds and road crashes. Hence, an essential part of road safety plans and interventions is devoted to speed management. However, to manage speed, actual travel speeds have to be systematically and consistently monitored and analyzed. In this study, a system for the collection and analysis of free-flow travel speeds on the road network is presented, enabling speed monitoring at the nationwide level. The paper focuses on the collection and analysis of travel speeds on different road sections. Using the information gathered through advanced technologies combined with geographical information systems, a comprehensive speed database in space and time is provided allowing visual presentation and comparison of the results. This analysis can identify the road sections with significant excesses of travel speeds relative to the speed limits. It can also serve as a baseline to evaluate the impact of various counter-measures employed to reduce speeds.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes the development and use of an open source, geospatially enabled framework and applies that platform to the analysis of freight truck travel time data that were extracted from the National Performance Management Research Dataset (NPMRDS). The NPMRDS is provided by HERE-Navteq and the American Transportation Research Institute under a contract with the U.S. Department of Transportation. The analysis platform is based on the PostgreSQL database and uses the PostGIS extension to enable spatial analysis inside the database. The study team developed a methodology to combine information from the NPMRDS, the National Highway Planning Network, and the Illinois Department of Transportation's Illinois Roadway Information System statewide roadway inventory. Geographic information system tools and the capabilities of the PostgreSQL database addressed incompatibilities and inconsistencies between supporting data sets and allowed the study team to find, access, use, and combine data from different sources. The study used these data sources to develop roadway performance measures for truck-rail intermodal connectors (IMCs) and compare these connectors with roads that had similar attributes. When compared with roadway segments with similar characteristics, speeds on IMCs often demonstrated greater uniformity and consistency.

AB Driver distraction and lack of,awareness of the driving situation are major causes of accidents in the urban areas in Taiwan; failing to obey traffic signals is the third leading accident cause. Numerous innovative in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) could be used collectively to provide drivers with a variety of information, such as messages from intersection collision warning systems (ICWS) by way of different in-vehicle interfaces. How the different IVIS interfaces influence driver workload and safety is always an important issue. This study investigates the effects of auditory ICWS messages on driver performance while the driver's visual, hearing, or mental processing attention resources (or all three) are engaged by secondary tasks. This type of engagement or distraction commonly occurs when a driver uses IVIS. The secondary tasks used to distract drivers were created by different types of mathematical questions presented with different types of display devices (e.g., voice from a speaker or numbers shown on a liquid crystal display screen or head-up display). Mixed linear models were employed to examine the factors influencing driver perception-reaction time with the consideration of repeated measures. Several factors, including several main factors and an interaction, were found to be significant. The most important finding was that the interaction between provision of ICWS information and the display format indicated that an auditory warning message could increase driver perception-reaction time while a driver was distracted by an auditory task. In addition, it was found that driver distraction due to different mental processing tasks had a significant impact on driver perception-reaction time.

AB Urban models useful in transportation planning are reviewed, focusing especially on ones that are based on geographic information system (GIS) software. Then UPlan, a simple model written by the authors in the ArcView GIS, is described. Several different applications of UPlan are outlined, involving transportation planning and analysis of the growth-inducing effects of new facilities, to demonstrate its use. Such models are coming into use for National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 assessments and for joint land use and transportation planning.

ID DECISIONS
AB Much of the push behind Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has come from the hope that providing travelers with better information will result in reduced travel time and traffic congestion. Phase 1 of the United States' IVHS National System Architecture project, for instance, made ATIS (Advanced Traveler Information Systems) the centerpiece of its benefits evaluation, and ATIS has been the subject of numerous traffic simulation studies. The objective of this paper is to examine the 'informational' assumptions embedded in traffic simulations, and to assess how these assumptions affect simulation results. Most importantly, this paper examines the hypothesis that increasing market penetration can lead to a decrement in network performance. The paper proves, for a simple parallel network, that increasing the market penetration of accurate information cannot harm network performance. For this same network, the paper shows that increasing the penetration of instantaneous travel time estimates might degrade network performance. The paper also asserts that the existence, or non-existence, of an optimal market penetration is moot. The suggestion is that ATIS should not be viewed as a strategy for achieving system optimal traffic distributions. ATIS should instead be viewed first as a service to the public, to improve their confidence and comfort in using the system, and second as a means for steering traffic away from dis-equilibrium behavior and toward user optima that utilize alternate routes where feasible.

ID TRAVEL MODE; BEHAVIOR; HABIT; ACQUISITION; CHOICE
AB Interest in advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) is increasing in modern cities, and more attention is given to real-time multimodal information. Through those systems, decision makers hope to achieve a shift from the car to alternative, environmentally friendly modes of travel. Few comprehensive assessments have been undertaken to verify the actual contribution of ATIS to such modal shift. In this paper, the effects on travel behavior of Optimod'Lyon, a multimodal real-time information navigator for the smartphone developed in Lyon, France, in 2013 and launched in May 2015, are assessed. To this end, a mixed method was adopted. A questionnaire was administered and focus groups were organized before and after the test of the application. A stratified sample of 50 people living in the metropolitan area of Lyon was also involved. The theory of planned behavior was used as the framework for the questionnaire design, which investigated attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. To evaluate behavioral change, data were analyzed through the use of parametric and nonparametric tests, factor analysis, and binary logistic regression. Survey participants were initially interested in Optimod'Lyon and showed a positive attitude toward its use. Before the test, they evaluated the travel planner positively but this lessened over time. After the test, use of the various travel modes remained stable. Consistency with regard to the most used mode and to behavioral patterns and attitudes was shown, strongly related to habits and to the frequency of past behavior.

TI UPlan - Geographic information system as framework for integrated land
   use planning model
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB A geographic information system (GIS) framework is appealing to model supply-side decisions because spatial relationships commonly used by developers to evaluate building sites, such as the proximity to transportation facilities, existing land uses, political boundaries, and environmentally sensitive areas, are defined precisely in the GIS layers. The GIS captures spatial synergisms that are lost in tabulations by traffic zone or larger forecasting districts. Further, the results are defined for individual parcels (grids). This method interfaces directly with the concerns of residents and other interest groups. Uncertainty and error in postmodel allocations from zones to parcels in existing land use models can significantly blur and degrade the relevance of forecasts made with existing models. The development patterns predicted by UPlan, a planning model, tend to be realistic and provide a basis for land use planning and evaluation. A GIS land use survey, supplemented with simulation model networks and census data, was used to calibrate the model. The calibrated UPlan model did a reasonably accurate job of allocating the various categories of land uses to predefined composite growth areas. The generalized UPlan model is applicable in a wide variety of rural, suburban, and urban settings. The model, as presented, was configured as a travel simulation integrated land use planning tool, but the method also can be used as the supply-side component within a comprehensive land use modeling framework.

AB A riding simulator study (n = 14) was conducted in order to test the sensitivity of performance measures, subjective ratings as well as physiological measures in controlled variations of rider workload. In a second study (n = 15), these parameters were used in order to assess the effects of different secondary tasks. The task of operating an on-bike information system led to the highest workload, for example, indicated by deteriorated lane keeping and higher subjective ratings compared with a simple visual, an auditory and no secondary task at all. The third study (n = 18) focused on the effects of eyes-off road while riding using the method of occlusion. This revealed that the participants felt safe to black out the scenery quite often and long. Periods of occlusion were related to a higher mean velocity and a tendency to ride more on the left side of the lane compared with riding with enabled projection.

The paper analyses and presents the methodological bases of building GIS with the aim of designing the traffic network topology, as well as structural and functional analysis which uses the acquired knowledge to propose concrete solutions on connecting data about the position of infrastructure facilities with their properties in the railway traffic safety.

AB Advanced traffic management systems (ATMS) and advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) are promising technologies for achieving efficiency in the operation of transportation systems. A simulation-based laboratory environment, MITSIMLab, is presented that is designed for testing and evaluation of dynamic traffic management systems. The core of MITSIMLab is a microscopic traffic simulator (MITSIM) and a traffic management simulator (TMS). MITSIM represents traffic flows in the network, and the TMS represents the traffic management system under evaluation. An important feature of MITSIMLab is its ability to model ATMS or ATIS that generate traffic controls and route guidance based on predicted traffic conditions. A graphical user interface allows visualization of the simulation, including animation of vehicle movements. An ATIS case study with a realistic network is also presented to demonstrate the functionality of MITSIMLab.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
AB Recent efforts to emphasize social equity in transportation are emerging as local, regional and national governments have set initiatives to identify, existing and potential, disproportionate impacts to low-income and minority populations, also referred to as transportation justice (TJ). Currently, there are suggested methods for identifying transportation justice areas; however, there is no streamlined method instituted across transportation agencies. Each jurisdiction identifies transportation justice (or environmental justice) areas based on their own methodology, typically based on either average regional thresholds, graduated thresholds, or a more unique in-house index methodology. This research explores and evaluates existing methods and develops a rigorous and comprehensive method called the Transportation Justice Threshold Index Framework (TJTIF) using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), as well as factors based on demographics, socio-economics, and transportation/land use. The framework is applied to a case study region in Pennsylvania reflective of the Marcellus Shale impact area, highlighting Sullivan County, PA. The methodology and the case study application serve as an example for how transportation agencies throughout the country can promote social sustainability and enhance transportation equity.

AB The automated road weather information system (RWIS) is used to continuously record the current and predicted status of driving conditions on the road network. By the end of 1999 there were more than 60 road weather stations in the Baltic countries and an additional 275 stations in Finland. The four countries have joined resources to develop a common Internet interface (www.balticroads.net) by which to share the existing RWIS data collected around the Baltic Sea region more effectively with the tramport sector and other road users. The overall goal of the Internet interface is to provide better access to accurate road weather information for the transport industry and the driving public, thus resulting in better service and improved traffic safety. The cooperation among the national road administrations improves utilization of the information from the existing RWIS in road maintenance operations. The possibilities to expand the Internet service are endless. It is possible to access the service through an Internet connection at border stations and gas stations, as well as to transfer the data via local radio operators and text-TV providers. The vision is also to extend the Internet service to cover road weather data from the neighboring countries in the Baltic Sea region. The Baltic RWIS Internet interface provides current data on local road weather such as road and air temperature, type of precipitation, road condition, wind speed and direction, and dew point and humidity.

DT Article
AB The concept of public logistics terminals (multi-company distribution centers) has been proposed in Japan to help alleviate traffic congestion, environment, energy and labor costs. These facilities allow more efficient logistics systems to be established and they facilitate the implementation of advanced information systems and cooperative freight systems. This paper describes a mathematical model developed for determining the optimal size and location of public logistics terminals. Queuing theory and nonlinear programming techniques are used to determine the best solution. The model explicitly takes into account traffic conditions in the network and was successfully applied to an actual road network in the Kyoto-Osaka area in Japan. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Automated Identification and Extraction of Horizontal Curve Information
   from Geographic Information System Roadway Maps
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID VEHICLE
AB Roadway horizontal alignment has long been recognized as one of the most significant contributing factors to lane departure crashes. Knowledge of the location and geometric information of horizontal curves can greatly facilitate the development of appropriate countermeasures. When curve information is unavailable, obtaining curve data in a cost-effective way is of great interest to practitioners and researchers. To date, many approaches have been developed to extract curve information from commercial satellite imagery, Global Positioning System survey data, laser-scanning data, and AutoCAD digital maps. As geographic information system (GIS) roadway maps become more accessible and more widely used, they become another cost-effective source for extraction of curve data. This paper presents a fully automated method for the extraction of horizontal curve data from GIS roadway maps. A specific curve data extraction algorithm was developed and implemented as a customized add-in tool in Arc Map. With this tool, horizontal curves could be automatically identified from GIS roadway maps. The length, radius, and central angle of the curves were also computed automatically. The only input parameter of the proposed algorithm was calibrated to have the least curve identification errors. Finally, algorithm validation was conducted through a comparison of the algorithm-extracted curve data with the ground truth curve data for 76 curves that were obtained from Bing aerial maps. The validation results indicated that the proposed algorithm was very effective and that it identified completely 96.7% of curves and computed accurately their geometric information.

AB This paper investigates the application of linear regression models and modeling techniques in predicting freight generation at the national level within the U.S. Specifically, the paper seeks to improve the performance and fit of linear regression models of freight generation. We provide insight into different variable transformation techniques, evaluate the use of spatial regression variables, and apply a spatial regression modeling methodology to correct for spatial autocorrelation. We conclude that the spatial regression model is the preferred specification for freight generation at the national level. The proliferation of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) within planning agencies affords more widespread use of spatial regression and our results indicate this technique would provide improvement to models that have been traditionally limited by insufficient data.

AB In transportation planning and design studies it is customary to consider the network in its equilibrium state. Equilibrium conditions in the presence of Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS) and recurrent congestion have been formulated either according to some behavioural principle derived from Wardrop's assumption, or as fixed-point states of day-to-day dynamic assignment processes. In the latter approach only, a differentiation has been introduced between predictive ATIS and ATIS providing static information, but the impacts on equilibrium travel times are relatively unexplored. In addition, the route choice updating model is formulated without consideration of state-dependent effects, such as inertia to change. This forms the motivation for the present paper. According to traffic information sources, three classes of users are considered: (a) users with predictive information, (b) users with static information and compliant, (c) users not equipped with ATIS or noncompliant. Users of the three classes make choices in a stochastic manner based on a logit model subject to inertia. Users of the first class have lower perception variance in view of the higher information quality. The compliance rate is endogenous and dependent on the information accuracy of the static ATIS. The fixed points in the class specific route flows of the dynamic day-to-day processes characterise a new concept of network equilibrium, referred to as Mixed User Equilibrium (MUE), where, if each user shifts from her currently used route to her newly chosen route, the observed class-specific route flows do not change. A variant of the method of successive averages is proposed for computing MUE. The model is illustrated by an example related to the Nguyen-Dupuis network. The impacts on equilibrium travel times of the market penetration of ATIS with different functionalities as well as of inertia are examined.

AB In recent years, persuasive interventions delivered through mobility-management tools have received attention as a means to motivate change for sustainable urban mobility. This paper aims to pinpoint and understand the drivers that influence individuals' travel decisions when using travel apps including both travel information and persuasive features. The analytical framework relies on Lindenberg's goal-framing theory in which individuals' motives for using travel apps are grouped into three overarching goals, namely (1) gain, (2) hedonic and (3) normative goal-frames. Furthermore, technophile attitude, community trust and place attachment are incorporated into the framework in order to better explain user-sided heterogeneity. The case-study focuses on the travel information system under development in Copenhagen (Denmark). It questions 822 Danish travelers by distributing a technology-use preference survey. Structural equation models revealed that the choice motivators are specific to individual users and depend on wide ranging factors that go beyond traditional economic and socio-demographic methods. The study reveals: (i) trip efficiency improvement, enjoyment, social interaction and environmentally-friendly travel promotion are important motives for using the new app; (ii) individuals have different intentions according to the perceived value of the new information system as well as travel purposes; (iii) technophile attitude exerts a positive influence on both user motives and use intention; (iv) social and institutional trust in addition to an affective bond to the city influence the use intention of the travel app.

   contextual effects
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT

DE Traffic exposure; Childhood asthma; Health disparities
ID ALLERGEN EXPOSURE; HEALTH; ENVIRONMENT; POVERTY; BOSTON; IMPACT
AB Transportation and health inequities have been subjects of study by scholars from various disciplines, but the linkages among traffic exposure, race, class, and asthma is neither sufficient nor conclusive. Previous studies suggest that the relationships are multifaceted and geographically specific. We investigate neighborhood social and transportation impacts on childhood asthma disparities in Tarrant County, Texas, using geographical information systems. Results reveal distinctive socio-demographic characteristics of the patients; clear spatial patterns of neighborhoods with and without asthma hospitalizations; and significant contextual effects of traffic density, race, and class on neighborhood childhood asthma hospitalizations. The findings generally support the notion of contextual effects. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Generating Route-Level Mutually Exclusive Service Areas Comparative
   Study of Alternative Methods
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID TRANSIT; DISTANCE; ACCESSIBILITY; IMPACTS
AB Willing-to-walk distance was investigated as a means of measuring spatial accessibility of bus stops and of examining the effectiveness of alternative methods of generating mutually exclusive transit service areas at the route level. First, the walking distance to and from a transit stop was investigated with onboard survey data. Two methods in geographical information systems the combination of Thiessen polygon and buffer and the network distance-based service area were compared as strategies for generating mutually exclusive service areas. For the examination of the effectiveness of these two methods, all mutually exclusive service areas were validated with a spider diagram generated from an onboard survey. Measures of urban form were also statistically tested for comparison of the two methods. A case study of a single route, serving the Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota, metropolitan area, was performed with data from various sources, such as Google's General Transit Feed Specification, an onboard survey, parcel-level land uses, and the U.S. Census street network. Validation with onboard survey data demonstrates the strengths of each method. Results also show that the network-based service area, a popular geographical information system method for service area analysis, does not yield a more meaningful strategy for generating mutually exclusive transit catchment areas, especially when spacing between stops is very small.

AB Evaluating ship encounters probability efficiently is significant for maritime transportation risk analysis as well as improving maritime traffic safety. In practice, ship encounters probability estimate by using traditional observation or field experiments is nearly impossible due to the expensive cast. In this paper, we propose a methodology framework for evaluating ship encounters probability based on an agent-based simulation paradigm. Individual ship's navigation behavior is modeled as an agent, and their encounters are detected by an innovative geographic information system (GIS)-based intelligent algorithm. We then design and implement a prototype simulator based on the methodology framework and apply it in the mid-western waters of Bohai Sea of China to demonstrate its functionalities and utility. The findings show that the framework proposed in this paper has potential to provide decision support for guiding future marine transportation planning. This paper offers new insights and valuable demonstration on promoting maritime traffic safety management with the integration of GIS and emerging complex system simulation technology.

ID RECOGNITION
AB A connected vehicle-based winter road surface condition (RSC) monitoring solution that combines vehicle-based image data with data from a road weather information system is described. The proposed solution was intended as an improvement to a smartphone-based system evaluated in previous research. Three machine learning classification methods-namely, artificial neural networks, random trees, and random forests-were evaluated for potential application in the connected vehicle-based system for RSC monitoring. Field data collected during the 2014-2015 winter season were used for model calibration and validation. Results showed that all models improved the accuracy of the smartphone-based RSC classification substantially, with random forest having the highest classification performance. The models, however, were found to lack transferability; therefore, individual models will require local calibration before being used at any location.

AB Occlusion is a measurement technique for assessing the visual demand and interruptability of in-vehicle information system (IVIS) tasks using a means for intermittent viewing of the IVIS displays/controls. Testing the visual demand of IVIS tasks using occlusion is gaining international support, largely due to it being a relatively simple method to use. Although an ISO occlusion standard has been published, some important issues remain; these include developing a robust and fully detailed measurement protocol. The age of participants is an important individual difference potentially affecting the validity and reliability of results from occlusion. To develop an effective protocol, the age ranges of participants need to be specified; otherwise experimenters undertaking measurements with varying age samples for the same systems/tasks may come to different conclusions. To assess the impact of age on occlusion task performance, 60 participants in various age ranges were tested on four different IVIS tasks. The results showed age-related differences; in particular, the older participants showed a greater spread of measurements. Excluding the issues of representative samples, the results imply that purely to obtain minimal inter-subject variability an occlusion measurement should use younger/middle-aged participants only.

AB This paper describes simulation studies that were conducted to assess the performance of a freeway corridor control system.  The system combines an advanced traffic management system with a motorist information system that provides route guidance to individual drivers.  It has a hierarchical structure:  The corridor level control acts in a supervisory capacity dynamically allocating traffic among alternative corridor facilities, including freeways, frontage roads, and signalized arterials.  The local level control then selects control parameters for the individual facilities based on the predicted usage at the corridor level.  A user specified performance function is optimized in the process.  Both recurrent and nonrecurrent congestion scenarios were simulated using the SCOT model as a test bed.  It is shown that, in most cases, significant benefits in performance can be obtained when the system operates as designed.

TI NEW HIGHWAY USES FOR AVI SYSTEMS
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Automatic vehicle identification (AVI) is the process and technology by which vehicles are uniquely identified without any action being required of the driver or by wayside observers.  The present status of AVI systems for revenue collection, road pricing, and heavy-vehicle highway management-information systems are described in this paper.  Specific AVI projects discussed include:  toll projects in Jacksonville, Florida; San Diego, California; Dallas, Texas; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Virginia; the San Francisco International Airport Commercial vehicle toll project; congestion pricing projects in Hong Kong and Singapore; and the HELP/Crescent Study.  Experience gained on these specific projects indicates that AVI is an effective and viable technology, but public acceptance, particularly for congestion pricing, is a major problem impeding implementation.  Progress on these individual AVI projects also suggests the need for increased coordination efforts.

AB Planning for sustainable development requires models that can represent the effects of land use and transportation policies on economic welfare, social equity, and the natural environment. Various urban models and geographic information system impact models have been in development for use in the Sacramento, California, region for several years. A comprehensive set of models is proposed. With the improvement of the urban economic model and the addition of a model for real-time scenario generation and evaluation, it is thought that a full suite of models exists for comprehensive regional planning. All the models are free, public license models, appropriate for application in large metropolitan planning organizations and other regional agencies.

TI Geographic Information System Concept of Operations as a First Step
   Toward Total Enterprise Asset Management Metro-North Commuter Railroad
   Case Study
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB For this enterprise geographic information system (GIS), Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company adopted the concept of operations (ConOps) process to define goals and objectives, inventory existing GIS assets, analyze data gaps, determine "as is" and "to be" business processes, define staffing and resource requirements and project initiatives, and provide a road map for a comprehensive, companywide GIS deployment. In contrast to the top-down approach typically employed in total enterprise asset management (TEAM) planning, Metro-North used a dynamic grassroots approach, holding 14 workshops, which were attended by 92 employees and were designed to collect GIS goals and objectives. The 122 goals generated from this process were distilled into eight companywide goals. These goals included increased efficiency, data sharing, and decision support. Initiatives were developed for five critical business areas that had the potential for demonstrating how enterprise GIS could help Metro-North accomplish its companywide and broader organizational goals. These pilot applications included visualizing straight-line diagrams, integrating property boundary data, retrieving drawings from the capital programs plan room, visualizing train tracking and delays, and visualizing ridership and demographics. This paper shows how a ConOps process could be used in railroad environments to think through GIS-related issues and to define concrete technology projects that provide tangible benefits to user departments and allow them to manage their assets and business issues. Although the focus of this study was on non-asset-related operations within the railroad, the ConOps process offers a user-centric systems planning approach that could be applied to TEAM efforts within the railroad industry or to the planning of corporate initiatives in any business environment.

AB A case study in the implementation and use of a customized geographic information system (GIS) as an administrative tool is described. A modified GIS is being used to provide full administrative support for a $4 million/year transportation grant program with a single part-time support staff person in the central office. Pennsylvania's Dirt and Gravel Road Pollution Prevention Program was enacted into law as Section 9106 of the State Vehicle Code in 1997 and is administered locally through county-based soil conservation districts. The program uses a simplified and customized GIS that enables personnel at 65 county conservation districts to use the system with minimal training. The customized GIS enabled a statewide assessment of more than 17,000 mi of unpaved roads to be conducted in 6 months. That assessment geographically identified and evaluated more than 11,000 pollution sites at which unpaved road runoff adversely affects stream quality. Pollution site assessments, record keeping, and reporting have been incorporated into the modified GIS to provide paperless, centralized reporting in keeping with the program's core values-streamlined administrative structure, emphasis on local control, and effective prevention of stream pollution from dust and sediment generated by unpaved roads. The value that a customized GIS can have for similar applications is illustrated by providing a walk-through of how the system works, why it has been accepted, and what it accomplishes for this innovative non-point-source pollution prevention effort.

   operational tests; ATIS
AB TravInfo is a multimodal traveler information system covering the San Francisco Bay Area, The system was intended to "collect and integrate available real-time data on all modes of surface transportation and ... broadly disseminate the data through an open system designed to meet the needs of Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS) firms" (Bay Area Ad Hoc IVHS Committee, 1992). This paper documents the institutional evaluation of TravInfo, covering the period from 1992 to 1997. It is based on interviews with key project members (three-waves), review of all meeting minutes, and first-hand observation of the organization throughout the period, TravInfo's primary successes have come in developing a network of public and private professionals, who have collaborated on ITS projects in a variety of venues. Unfortunately, however, TravInfo has not accomplished most of its initial objectives, largely due to a variety of institutional problems. Though some of the problems might be attributed to bad luck, the majority may simply be endemic to the concept. That is, by developing a public/private partnership whose primary purpose is to integrate and centralize traveler information, major institutional problems are bound to occur.

AB Managers in charge of the California operations of nearly 1200 trucking companies were asked their opinions regarding how useful various sources of traffic information are to their dispatchers and to their drivers. They were also asked to evaluate the usefulness of improved traveler information systems. Nonlinear canonical correlation analysis was used to link company characteristics and perceptions of the value of the sources. Results showed that evaluations of sources such as Internet traffic information, in-vehicle navigation systems, and area-wide dedicated highway advisory radio are primarily related to the location of operations, whether a trucking operation is private or for-hire, the average length of the company's load moves, and the provision of intermodal services.

TI Uncertainty Issues in Integrating Geographic Information Systems and the
   Global Positioning System for Transportation
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The Global Positioning System (GPS) and geographic information systems (GIS) have been integrated for a wide range of transportation applications. When a linear datum is not implemented into the applications, a route measure is indirectly determined with snapped GPS-derived coordinates along roadway centerlines. Thus, uncertainties in output information are subject to various types of error and error sources in GPS and roadway centerline maps and their propagation through spatial operations. A method for uncertainty analysis is presented. The method estimates the quality of output information from GPS- and GIS-integrated applications for transportation. The method involves an analytical GPS error model and an error propagation model, assuming that a test roadway centerline map is representative of roadway centerline maps with the same nominal scale. In the case study, the method was applied to a winter maintenance application and a travel time study. The optimum input data set for each application was determined by sensitivity analysis that explored the impact of positional uncertainties on variations of output information computed from distance-based and non-distance-based computation models. Results indicated that the winter maintenance application required accurate input data because uncertainties in output information were accumulated as winter maintenance vehicles repeatedly treated roadways. However, for the travel time study, consistent output information was computed with a minute level of accuracy, so positional uncertainties in input data had a negligible impact on output information.

TI Measurement of Uncertainty Costs with Dynamic Traffic Simulations
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID URBAN FREEWAY CONGESTION; INFORMATION PROVISION; CHOICE; TIME
AB Nonrecurrent congestion in transportation networks occurs as a consequence of stochastic factors affecting demand and supply. Intelligent transportation systems such as advanced traveler information systems and advanced traffic management systems are designed to reduce the impacts of nonrecurrent congestion by providing information to a fraction of users or by controlling the variability of traffic flows. For these reasons, the design of these systems requires a reliable forecast of nonrecurrent congestion. A new method is proposed to measure the impacts of nonrecurrent congestion on travel costs by taking risk aversion into account. The traffic model is based on the dynamic traffic simulation model METROPOLIS. Incidents are generated randomly by reducing the capacity of the network. Users can instantaneously adapt to the unexpected travel conditions or can also change their behavior through a day-to-day adjustment process. Comparisons with incident-free simulations provide a benchmark for potential travel time savings that can he brought about by a state-of-the-art information system. The impact of variable travel conditions is measured by describing the willingness to pay to avoid risky or unreliable Journeys. Indeed, for risk-averse drivers, any uncertainty corresponds to a utility loss. This utility loss is computed for several levels of network disruption. The main result of the study is that the utility loss due to uncertainty is of the same order of magnitude as the total travel costs.

TI Improving Shuttle Ridership Using Intelligent Transportation System

ID SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION
AB In Arizona, the Grand Canyon National Park's south rim experiences severe traffic and parking congestion during the summer. To alleviate the issues, a free pilot shuttle route was operated between the gateway community of Tusayan and the park's information plaza during the 2008 summer season. During the pilot program, a traveler information system consisting of a portable dynamic message sign and highway advisory radio was implemented along Route 64 with the intent to increase shuttle ridership. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the intelligent transportation system on shuttle ridership. Data were collected during the pilot program, before and after the implementation of this system. Different analysis methods including multiple linear regression, backpropagation neural network, and support vector regression were applied for analysis. The results found that the support vector regression method performed best in modeling shuttle ridership and associated explanatory variables (traffic volume and system deployment). The results from support vector regression suggested that the traveler information system increased shuttle ridership by 30%, which was consistent with the results from visitor surveys that were completed at the same time as this study. The study showed that the system was effective in shifting visitors from passenger cars to free shuttle buses.

   information systems (TISs); vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)
AB Currently, distributed traffic information systems have come up as one of the most important approaches for detecting traffic flow problems on a road. For that purpose, they usually make use of the location information that vehicles share among them through periodical messages that are transmitted across a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). This paper puts forward an event-driven architecture (EDA) as a novel mechanism to get insight into VANET messages to detect different levels of traffic jams; furthermore, it also takes into account environmental data that come from external data sources, such as weather conditions. The proposed EDA has been developed through the complex-event-processing technology. Simulation tests show that the proposed mechanism can detect traffic congestions, which involve different numbers of lanes and lengths with short delay.

TI The estimation of highway geometry for road accident analysis
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT
LA English
DT Article
DE roads & highways; traffic engineering; transport management
AB There is no documentation recording the geometric alignment of the greater part of Britain's road network. Highway geometry is an important factor in road accidents, particularly in rural areas where speeds are high and injuries tend to be severe and numbers of sites requiring investigation are large. Hence there is an important role for new tools that can estimate the geometry, for use in accident research and in other applications that depend on two- or three-dimensional visualization without on-site surveying. This paper describes methods for estimating horizontal and vertical curvature from digital data sources and the development of a geographical information system (GIS) application that can link accident data to the alignment. It is anticipated that such an application will provide a platform for future research to improve the understanding of the relationships between accident frequency and highway geometry.

AB During the last year eco-friendly driving and the development of new driver assistance systems that support eco-friendly driving are increasingly becoming important. One main objective of research in this area is finding ways of motivating drivers to behave ecologically beneficially in a sustainable way and identifying how these motives can be generated, for example, through in-vehicle assistance or information systems. One aim of the following study was to develop a matrix of the most important eco-friendly driving motives, moderating and influencing factors (e.g. trip purpose, annual mileage). Another objective was analysis of the influence of different driver characteristics on relevant motives and to deduce first hints for development of applications for generating these motives. The results of the questionnaire study demonstrate that three main motives 'time', 'environment/consumption' and 'possibilities to change' are selectively important and distinctive for various driver groups. The results therefore imply that different strategies and applications or systems might be necessary to change the driver behaviour and to convince them that the 'eco-system' will be beneficial for them. Furthermore, the results describe ideas of what kind of assistance or information systems the drivers would prefer as a support system. This information can help in the design of future eco-driving support systems.

AB A wide range of public transport schemes have been proposed and put in practice to improve bus service reliability (including bus lanes, bus priority signals, passenger information systems, etc.). Central to the successful evaluation of such operational and management measures is to have reliability indicators which are easy to measure and can be used readily by operators to identify unreliable services and by regulatory authorities to set standards. This paper investigates measures to assess reliability, such as headway, excess waiting time, service regularity and recovery time of an urban network, using a dynamic micro-simulation model (DRACULA). In this paper, the model results from a test case study are presented. The significant factors affecting each measure are identified and the relative merits of the indicators are discussed with regard to their practical contribution to public transport reliability.

AB Efficient and timely response during accidents has received increased attention from practitioners and researchers. The siting of emergency service facilities (ESFs) plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of safety protection and emergency response. This paper explores a novel multiobjective ant algorithm for the siting of ESFs. With the aid of the geographic information system, the algorithm finds a population of solutions, uses Pareto ranking to sort these solutions, and derives the Pareto front. It is demonstrated that the algorithm successfully captures a pool of nondominated solutions and thereby provides decision makers with a set of alternative solutions. The case study also demonstrates how decision makers may choose one "best" solution from the pool according to their preference or determinant criteria.

AB A variety of factors are involved in inter-city transportation route selection in the areas of complex terrain. With the help of Geographic Information System (GIS), three quantitative methods were employed to determine the transport routes between 44 cities in Northern Yunnan (China), an area with alpine valleys, Karst mountains, and plateau basins. The network analysis in GIS was used to find the routes based on the Transport Suitability Evaluation (TSE) map, which was produced from several factors, including population density, terrain slope, vertical terrain dissection, landslide and mud flock area, land cover types, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), and Delphi analysis were used to collect and calculate suitability values of these factors. Finally, all the mutes connecting 44 cities of Northern Yunnan formed a network which could provide reference for route selection planning in the area.

AB Numerous consumer surveys conclude that users of advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) perceive benefits foremost in travel time, followed by benefits of stress reduction and on-time arrival. Efforts by ATIS evaluators to quantify or empirically validate these benefits through field trials have yielded findings in travel time savings that are inconsistent with findings from surveys. It is hypothesized that users of ATIS benefit in the form of time management and not necessarily by reducing in-vehicle travel time. A novel approach (the simulated yoked study) is presented to evaluate the benefits to commuters from regular ATIS use. To demonstrate the simulated yoked study approach and to test the hypothesis, a case study based on travel conditions in Washington, D.C., between August 1, 1999, and October 1, 1999, was conducted. The travel experiences of commuters regularly using pretrip ATIS are simulated and compared with those of similar commuters using no traveler information before or during their commute. Findings from the case study indicate that benefits are significant in terms of on-time reliability but not in terms of the most frequently used measure of ATIS effectiveness, reduction of in-vehicle travel time. On average, regular pretrip ATIS users can reduce late arrivals by 69 percent and total late schedule delay by 72 percent compared with their counterparts. The regional reliability of the pretrip ATIS service, defined as the percentage of trips using pretrip ATIS that have arrival expectations that are met, is estimated at 77 percent. Analyses of pretrip ATIS user expectations, outcomes, and counterpart outcomes indicated that users' perceptions of ATIS satisfaction are accurate.

AB Vehicle detectors, which collect passing vehicle information and traffic condition in real time, are one of the most basic elements for the implementation of efficient traffic management and information systems. This paper develops an ultrasonic vehicle detector (UVD) system that can be implemented in a side-fire configuration. Conventionally, UVD systems are installed using overhanging structures or bridges in overhead configurations. In this overhead configuration, the sensors are mounted directly over the road surface. If these sensors can be mounted from the side of a roads the installation cost can be reduced. In addition, the aesthetic integrity of roadways will not be affected very much. However, this side-fire configuration has not been used, because of the fact that vehicles generally do not have sufficiently large oblique-angled surfaces to reflect the emitted ultrasonic wave back to the sensor for detection. This paper reports on the feasibility of a side-fire UVD system. A new low-cost instrumentation and control system for side-fire implementation was developed, and comprehensive experiments were performed at highway and downtown test sites. Experimental conditions included various traffic conditions as well as various weather conditions, including daylight, dusk, night, heavy rain, and heavy snow. Traffic data were generated for every five minutes. For the highway location, the vehicle counting error was less than 1%. For the downtown location, the error was approximately 3% during normal weather conditions and approximately 5% during a snow storm. The larger error in downtown is mainly attributed to vehicles changing lane. We believe that these side-fire implementation results are adequate for implementing advanced traveler information systems (ATIS).

AB The relationship between land use and the utility of automobile travel is examined by refining the utility concept, particularly by combining the microeconomic utility theory, which is concerned with the disutility of travel, and the perspective on the positive utility. A conceptual model is accordingly developed and then adjusted considering different purposes of travel. The purpose-specific models are tested through a Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes approach in Seoul, Korea, using datasets from a sample survey and geographic information systems. The major finding is that land use affects the utility mainly by changing synergy and affective utility rather than instrumental utility, which encompasses disutility variables. Among land use variables, the utility is found to be the most sensitive to the number of transit facilities for commuting and shopping travel and land use balance for leisure travel.

AB Current geographic information systems typically offer limited analytical capabilities and lack the flexibility to support spatial decision making effectively. Spatial decision support systems aim to fill this gap. Following this approach, this paper describes an operational system for integrated land-use and transportation planning called Location Planner. The system integrates a wide variety of spatial models in a flexible and easy-to-use problem solving environment. Users are able to construct a model out of available components and use the model for impact analysis and optimization. Thus, in contrast to existing spatial decision support systems, the proposed system allows users to address a wide range of problems. The paper describes the architecture of the system and an illustrative application. Furthermore, the potentials of the system for land-use and transportation planning are discussed.

ID MOTOR-VEHICLE CRASHES; MODEL
AB Bridges are an integral infrastructure component and, as such, have been the subject of extensive research efforts related to structural performance. However, there has been little study on the traffic safety performance of bridges, which have very different physical and operational characteristics compared with regular roadway facilities. This study develops safety performance functions (SPFs) for overall vehicle crashes and single-vehicle crashes occurring on major highway bridges in Alabama. The bridge characteristic data and crash information are obtained from three different databases. Geographic information systems (GIS) are used to spatially represent bridges as vectors and associate crashes to the bridges based on location attributes from the crash data. SPFs of several functional forms are developed and investigated for identifying the best model using negative binomial regression. The models are validated by comparing their relative predictive capabilities. This paper recommends models that fit the Alabama data well. These models can be used for estimating the expected number of crashes on bridges along major highways in Alabama. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI Automated Tool for Geographic Information Systems That Supports Transit
   Network Design by Identifying Urban Activity Centers
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Public transit is central to sustainable multimodal transportation systems; however, designing an effective transit network remains an analytically challenging and complex task. Given the spatial nature of the problem, geographic information systems (GISs) can support transit network design by identifying subsections of urban areas within and between which very high travel demand exists. Once these corridors are identified. local knowledge and expertise may be used to develop routings that satisfy these demands. This paper presents a spatial approach to assist in designing transit networks and describes the development and application of an automated, spatial mullierileria aggregation algorithm implemented as a user-friendly GIS tool coded by using the Python scripting library (ArcPy). Using population and employment densities, spatial adjacency, and geographic and administrative boundaries, the GIS tool leverages readily available demographic data to classify and merge traffic analysis zones into larger urban activity centers. The tool then aggregates regional origin-destination matrices to visualize only the flows associated with the activity centers. The results show that this approach significantly reduces the number of origins and destinations to be considered in designing the network but retains a large proportion of regional trips. This paper demonstrates how the tool can be applied through an example from the region of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, where the local transit agency is developing a transit network to support a central light-rail transit line.

DT Article
ID DISTANCE TRANSFORM; HIGHWAY
AB Intercity railway transit is the primary way to transfer passengers and freight over long distances on land. The design of an intercity railway alignment is usually challenging and complex because of great topographic variations and intersections with many existing geographic objects. This paper presents a bilevel optimization model for intercity railway alignment (BRAO) following the horizontal-vertical alignment design philosophy. The upper level is the horizontal alignment optimization, while the nested lower level is the vertical alignment optimization. A multistage augmented differential evolution algorithm is adopted for the solution at both levels. BRAO could generate corridor alignment, initial alignment, and optimal alignment through different allocations of the number and boundaries of decision variables. A real-world case study of railway design is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the BRAO model based on a geographic information system.

DE Inter-vehicle communication; Stochastic process; General vehicle headway
AB Effective inter-vehicle communication is fundamental to a decentralized traffic information system based on mobile ad hoc vehicle networks. Here we model the information propagation process through inter-vehicle communication when the vehicle spacing follows a general i.i.d. distribution. Equations for the expected value and variance of propagation distance are derived. In addition, we provide simple equations for the expected number of vehicles covered and the probability distribution of propagation distance. This research advances on an earlier study where the vehicle spacing is assumed to follow an exponential distribution. This paper generalizes the earlier results and potentially enables a design for robust information propagation by allowing for examination of the impact of different headway distributions. Within the new modeling framework, we also compute connectivity between two vehicles. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CONGESTION
AB This paper discusses the congestion relief and environmental impacts expected of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) based on a qualitative assessment of the incentives generated. It uses theoretical and empirical results from the literature to evaluate the private and externality impacts of Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS), Automated High;Nay Systems (AHS) and Intelligent Transit Systems and discusses the appropriate role of the public sector in their development based on these impacts. It is argued that although ITS are intended to improve system efficiency, the technologies may, in fact, exacerbate the existing, economic inefficiencies in the surface transportation system and that policies to correct these inefficiencies become all the more crucial as we consider implementation of ITS. Several policies that target environmental externalities are discussed as possible complements to ITS.

AB The aim of this paper is to contribute to the methodological questions that arise from the study of the simultaneous choice of residential location and travel-to-work mode under central and non-central or suburban employment patterns. Geographic information system (GIS) visualisations and network analysis are used to generate a choice set based on the definition of spatially aggregated alternatives. Discrete choice models specified as cross-nested logit (CNL) are estimated for each of the two different types of employment patterns and direct and cross elasticities are presented. The analysis is carried out for the Greater Dublin Area, a metropolitan region that is a recent example of rapid employment suburbanisation and residential sprawl in a European context. A simulation exercise, tracing the extent of mode switching and location switching behaviour is undertaken using the framework developed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION-SYSTEM; MODEL
AB Dynamic segmentation is viewed as one of the most important functions of geographic information systems for transportation applications. Although the road network and associated events (e.g., pavement material, traffic volume, incidents) can be referenced to both space and time, the spatial and temporal dimensions have not been well integrated. Modeling space-varying, time-varying, and space-time-varying events in dynamic segmentation by using an object database approach that is in line with the Object Database Management Group standard is explored. A mechanism called parametric polymorphism is used to lift conventional data types to spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal types for maintaining knowledge about events that could change spatially, temporally, and spatiotemporally along linear features. An associated object query language, DSOQL, was designed to support the formulation of spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal queries on the road and event information.

AB Transportation network design is a method for analyzing the interactive benefits of transportation projects applied to a network. In this paper, a network design model is developed for long haul freight movements which are represented by relationships between shippers and carriers. Additionally, an explicit capacity constraint is used to divert traffic volume from congested links. A case study based on the California transportation network is implemented to examine the effectiveness of this model when applied to a large network. A geographic information system is used to facilitate data management and analysis of the results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Feature Selection for Enhancing Purpose Imputation using Global
   Positioning System Data without Geographic Information System Data
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID GPS DATA; TRIP PURPOSE
AB This paper presents a method for enhancing purpose imputation from global positioning system data without using geographic information system data via relevant feature selection from six groups: (1) activity time; (2) user characteristics; (3) predicted travel modes; (4) actual travel modes; (5) estimated home location; and (6) estimated location of the most frequently visited non-home place (MFVP). Two datasets were collected in 2019 using TRavelVU, a smartphone application. The first one (the Hanoi dataset) comprised 652 days' worth of data collected from 63 users in Hanoi, Vietnam, whereas the second one (the Donate dataset) comprised 932 days' worth of information collected from 65 individuals in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. The hyperparameters of the random forest models were tuned carefully in accordance with selected features, thereby facilitating a thorough evaluation of the improvement in prediction models. The findings of this study revealed that the addition of either actual or predicted modes resulted in improved imputation performance, albeit the former exhibited a stronger positive effect. This demonstrated the potential benefits of integrating mode detection and purpose identification into a continuous process. The newly adopted MFVP feature contributed to enhanced prediction results (around 2%). The proposed purpose-imputation models, which benefited from all features, demonstrated accuracies of the order of 75% and 85% for the Hanoi and Donate datasets, respectively. The imputation of home and work/education activities demonstrated high success, whereas reasonable prediction results with nearly all F-score levels ranging between 50% and 83% were observed for pick-up/drop-off, shopping/eating, visit/leisure, and business activities.

AB The use of computer image generation technologies within the transportation field to aid both the design and the user communities to visualize better the essential elements of a proposed facility's structure as well as its operation is addressed. The primary focus is on current and future applications of these technologies and their integration within the overall notion of context-sensitive design and public involvement. The discussion suggests that a movement away from the visualization of what something looks like to the visualization of how something works or operates is being encountered, a trend that forces the integration of modeling and simulation. The discussion also suggests the importance of applications that use visualization to help bridge the gap between notions of design and notions of value. Such applications also reflect an increased integration of design-oriented applications and planning-oriented applications, such as those that incorporate the use of spatially referenced data systems such as geographic information systems.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate the solution algorithm for solving the problem of determining reliable shortest paths in road networks with stochastic travel times. The availability of reliable shortest paths enables travelers, in the face of travel time uncertainty, to plan their trips with a pre-specified on-time arrival probability. In this study, the reliable shortest path between origin and destination nodes is determined using a multiple-criteria shortest path approach when link travel times follow normal distributions. The dominance conditions involved in such problems are established, thereby reducing the number of generated non-dominated paths during the search processes. Two solution algorithms, multi-criteria label-setting and A* algorithms, are proposed and their complexities analyzed. Computational results using large scale networks are presented. Numerical examples using data from a real-world advanced traveller information system is also given to illustrate the applicability of the solution algorithms in practice.

AB A better understanding of rail trespass crashes is needed as more than 400 trespassing related fatalities occur along rail tracks each year in the United States (U.S.). The objective of this research was to investigate factors associated with the occurrence of rail trespass crashes. Yearly crash frequency for counties in the U.S. with train tracks was modeled using a Mixed-effects Negative Binomial Model based on 2012-2016 datasets from the Federal Railroad Administration, the U.S. Census Bureau and National Historical Geographic Information System. Results revealed that key factors affecting rail trespassing crashes include county population density, length of rail tracks in a county, median age and male proportion of the county population, and average train traffic within a county. The findings provided useful information on improving public safety along railroad tracks.

DE DURATION MODELS; HAZARD FUNCTIONS; QUEUING; VEHICLE DELAY
AB Delays caused by congestion at the US/Canadian border crossing between Washington state and British Columbia have underscored the need for some sort of intervention. One obvious congestion-mitigation measure would be to estimate delay times and then relay this information to motorists so that they could select among alternative border crossing sites, or delay their trips. This paper applies duration models to estimate vehicular delay and demonstrates the usefulness of such models as a basis for a fully automated motorist information system. The paper also explores the flexibility of duration models, in providing estimates of vehicle delay, by using alternate parametric forms and assessing prediction accuracy.

AB This article presents an approach to problems of emergency management on motorways using a Decision Support System (DSS). The advantages of this approach in comparison with conventional operational methods are acceptable data management costs provided by spatial data already stored in a Geographical Information System (GIS), generation of new data using various spatial functions as well as transparency for all emergency services. DSS deploys GIS in conjunction with other decision models thus becoming a powerful tool for the coordination of all participants in a decision-making process during emergency situations giving them a more cooperative surrounding. For the purpose of more efficient emergency management on motorways, the main idea is to provide an organisational support by combining GIS with decision models in order to provide an effective spatial DSS concept.

TI Predicting bus arrival time an the basis of global positioning system

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The ability to obtain accurate predictions of bus arrival time on a real-time basis is a vital element to both bus operations control and passenger information systems. Several studies had been devoted to this arrival time prediction problem; however, few resulted in completely satisfactory algorithms. This paper presents a new system that can be used to predict the expected bus arrival times at individual bus stops along a service route. The proposed prediction algorithm combines real-time location data from Global Positioning System receivers with average travel speeds of individual route segments, taking into account historical travel speed as well as temporal and spatial variations of traffic conditions. A geographic information system-based map-matching algorithm is used to project each received location onto the underlying transit network. The system is implemented as a finite state machine to ensure its regularity, stability, and robustness under a wide range of operating conditions. A case study on a real bus route is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of prediction accuracy. The results indicate that the proposed system is capable of achieving satisfactory accuracy in predicting bus arrival times and perfect performance in predicting travel direction.

TI Bayesian approach based an geographic information system to identify
   hazardous roadway segments for traffic crashes
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents a Bayesian approach based on a geographic information system (GIS) for areawide identification of hazardous roadway segments for traffic crashes. The conventional observed relative crash risks of roadway segments are based on the observed crash count data and often feature very small or very large outlying relative risks in segments with low traffic volumes or short segment lengths; thus the risk maps based on observed crash risks show a high uncertainty. The Bayesian approach can incorporate both the variability in the observed risks and spatial autocorrelation and use the typical Bayesian "borrow of strength" from adjacent segments to filter out the uncertainties, smooth the relative risks, and accurately identify and rank roadway segments with potentially high relative risks for crashes. To capture the real safety indications better, this paper also disaggregates different road segment types and utilizes GIS to analyze the crash data and visualize the spatial relative crash risks in three-dimensional views. Houston, Texas, is chosen as the study area, and three crash data sets (all KAB crashes: crashes with fatality [K], incapacitating injury [A], and nonincapacitating injury [B]; KAB crashes under unsafe speeding; and KAB crashes under the influence of alcohol) in year 2000 are analyzed. Results demonstrate that the approach is effective in spatially smoothing the relative crash risks and eliminating the instability of estimates, while maintaining real safety trends, especially for data with a small sample size and large variance. The result provides a sound basis for implementing preventive actions to reduce crashes on high-risk segments.

AB The environmental impact of a hazardous material spill is a complex function of the material's physical and chemical characteristics and the local environmental conditions in which it is spilled. This study develops a geographical probability distribution for two important environmental parameters affecting this impact: soil type and groundwater depth. The paper assesses the probability of exposure of various soil types and groundwater depth regions to hazardous material spills from railroad tank car accidents. The State Soil Geographic database (STATSGO), a geographic information system (GIS) database from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was used to analyze soils, and real-time groundwater data from the U.S. Geological Survey were used to analyze groundwater. The "rail2m" GIS database available from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics was used to conduct overlay analyses with the soil GIS data to obtain the probability of occurrence of various soil types under rail lines. The same method could not be used for groundwater exposure because no suitable GIS database for this parameter was available. Therefore, a nationwide probability distribution of the groundwater depth ranges was developed. The proportion of the three soil types under rail lines was 44.0% for sand, 51.2% for silt, and 4.0% for clay, the remainder being over surface water. The probability of occurrence of five groundwater depth regions was 16.4 % for 5 to 15 ft, 12.6 % for 15 to 25 ft, 23.3% for 25 to 75 ft, 12.0% for 75 to 125 ft, and 35.9% for greater than 125 ft. A matrix of the probability distribution of environmental scenarios was developed; it is suitable for use in conducting environmental risk assessments of railroad transportation of hazardous materials.

AB This paper develops a comprehensive approach to the definition of transportation analysis zones (TAZ), and therein, presents a new methodology and algorithm for the definition of TAZ embedded in geographic information systems software, improves the base algorithm with several local algorithms, and comprehensively analyses the obtained results. The results obtained are then compared to these presently used in the transportation analysis process of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. The proposed algorithm presents a new methodology for TAZ design based on a smoothed density surface of geocoded travel demand data. The algorithm aims to minimise the loss of information when moving from a continuous representation of the origin and destination of each trip to their discrete representations through zones, and focuses on the trade-off between the statistical precision, geographical error, and the percentage of intra-zonal trips of the resulting OD matrix. The results for the Lisbon Metropolitan Area case study suggest a significant improvement in OD matrix estimates compared to current transportation analysis practises based on administrative units.

AB This article discusses how to efficiently and completely solve a bi-objective pavement maintenance and rehabilitation-scheduling problem, which aims at optimizing two objectives of pavement condition improvement and budget utilization in a simultaneous manner. This problem may be addressed by the weighting method, constraint method, ranking method, and various metaheuristic methods. However, none of these methods can guarantee the complete Pareto-optimal solution set, which would potentially lead to suboptimal decisions. In this article, a parametric method is suggested to solve the bi-objective pavement maintenance and rehabilitation-scheduling problem. The effectiveness and efficiency of the parametric method is investigated and demonstrated through a case study using the real-world data set from the Dallas District's Pavement Management Information System. A performance comparison between the widely used weighting method and the parametric method clearly justifies the computational advantages of the parametric method.

AB The performance and complicated interactions of different classes of travelers on regional urban networks are presented and analyzed. A new multi-class extension of a regional dynamic traffic model, the Network Transmission Model is proposed. The classes in question correspond to travelers using autonomous vehicles, conventional vehicles, equipped with Route Guidance and Information Systems, and unequipped vehicles. Each class is represented by a different routing method. Incremental Route Planning, an innovative predictive simulation-based routing method, Proxy Regret Matching, a non-predictive strategic learning-based method and Multinomial Logit-based Routing for 1st, 2nd and 3rd class respectively. All routing methods include a Public Transit Diversion mechanism and are assumed to provide prescriptive route guidance, with pre-trip information dissemination for every departing vehicle. We consider the possibility of non-compliance for conventional vehicles equipped with Route Guidance and Information Systems. We also consider 2 possible scenarios for autonomous vehicles that affect their travel time prediction accuracy. We simulate regional traffic dynamics for simultaneous application of all aforementioned routing methods, employing a market penetration scheme for each class of travelers. We analyze results regarding the overall network performance for various combinations of traveler class market penetration rates and non-compliance rates. We come to the conclusion that autonomous vehicles will not only provide benefits for 1st class travelers, but for all traveler classes on the network.

AB Despite emerging evidence about the association between the built environment and travel behavior, the relationship between bus transit demand and urban form remains largely unexplored. By relying on primary and secondary data analyzed with a geographic information system, this paper examines the built environment characteristics related to stop-level ridership for Bogota's successful bus rapid transit system. After accounting experimentally and statistically for the simultaneity between transit supply, transit demand, and the built environment, we find evidence of the importance of the built environment in BRT station boardings. Specifically, environmental supports for walking and personal and environmental barriers to car use were related to higher BRT boardings. Our results underscore the importance of urban environmental interventions to support transit use. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Through a survey of expert cyclists, the relationship between the actual routes cyclists traveled and existing street conditions was documented, and bicycle commuters of the Phoenix metropolitan area were profiled. Data were collected on individual commuting routes between home and work. Additional data collected include age and gender characteristics. Frequency analysis in a geographic information system compared the number of common street segments among actual and alternative routes to determine cyclists' use of existing street facilities. Findings are reported for actual routes compared with shortest distance, shortest time, and safest route alternatives on street facilities between the same origin and destination. Spatial analysis identified local gaps in arterial street bicycle facilities at municipal boundaries. These findings include evidence that cyclists adjust their routes to use current street bicycle facilities, and suggest that policy makers should concentrate on linking bicycle facilities across jurisdictions.

TI Forecasting Model for Air Taxi, Commercial Airline, and Automobile
   Demand in the United States
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB A nationwide model predicts the annual county-to-county person round-trips for air taxi, commercial airline, and automobile at 1-year intervals through 2030. The transportation systems analysis model (TSAM) uses the four-step transportation systems modeling process to calculate trip generation, trip distribution, and mode choice for each county origin-destination pair. Network assignment is formulated for commercial airline and air taxi demand. TSAM classifies trip rates by trip purpose, household income group, and type of metropolitan statistical area from which the round-trip started. A graphical user interface with geographic information systems capability is included in the model. Potential applications of the model are nationwide impact studies of transportation policies and technologies, such as those envisioned with the introduction of extensive air taxi service using very light jets, the next-generation air transportation system, and the introduction of new aerospace technologies.

TI Translating Transportation Data Between Linear Referencing Systems of
   Dissimilar Resolution
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The Wisconsin Department of Transportation uses two linear referencing systems (LRSs) for complete mapping of crashes statewide: the State Trunk Network (STN), which represents only state routes, and the Wisconsin Information System for Local Roads (WISLR), which includes all roads but gives specific detail for local routes. A functional link between the two systems was developed; this link allows data to be translated from the STN, a higher-resolution representation, to the WISLR, a lower-resolution representation. Although data are easily translated from high to low resolution, ambiguities arise when data are moved from low resolution to high resolution.

AB One of the key components of real-time bus information systems is knowledge of bus locations in real time. With recent advancements in sensing and communication technologies, location data can be obtained frequently and incorporated into the estimation models. One important issue is determining the suitable time interval at which location data should be chosen as input for estimation models. This paper explores the impact of the time interval of real-time bus location data on the accuracy of bus arrival estimation. It also examines by how much, and at what distance, real-time arrival information can outperform information provided from a static schedule for a given estimation technique. This study also investigates the cutoff horizon,' the threshold horizon beyond which real-time information no longer outperforms information based on a particular static schedule, and how the cutoff horizon changes with the time interval of bus location data.

AB This study investigated the spatial and temporal effects of rainfall intensity on traffic crashes in Hong Kong. A geographic information system technique was used to correlate and match data collected at rain gauge stations with the time and location of traffic crashes in 2009. A total of 436 matched-pair datasets were selected to study the spatial and temporal relationships between hourly rainfall intensity and traffic crashes. The first hour of rainfall and the first hour after rain were shown to be the periods with the highest number of traffic crashes. Moreover, hourly periods with average rainfall intensities of 19 and 26 mm were found to have the highest risk, when the increase in the number of crashes per hour was the greatest.

DE Highway alignment optimization; Highway design and planning; Highway

AB This paper presents an intelligent optimization tool that assists planners and designers in finding preferable highway alignments, connecting specified endpoints or zones. It integrates genetic algorithms with a geographic information system (GIS) for optimizing highway alignments and processes massive amounts of relevant data associated with highway design and alternative evaluation. To show the applicability of the proposed model to a real-world problem, two actual highway projects in the state of Maryland have been analyzed using the model. An extensive analysis of sensitivity to key model parameters is also conducted to describe the model capabilities. The analysis results show that the model can effectively optimize highway alignments in an area combining complex terrain and various types of natural and cultural land-use patterns, and provide detailed information of optimized alignments as a model output. It is also found that the alignments optimized by the model are quite similar to those obtained through conventional manual methods by a state agency, but the model can greatly reduce the time required for highway planning and design as well as produce lower cost solutions. Finally, the results confirm that all dominating and alignment-sensitive costs should be simultaneously evaluated in the alignment optimization process because many trade-off opportunities exist among those costs. The proposed model can greatly contribute to the productivity of highway planners as well as to the quality of the resulting infrastructure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a stochastic dynamic transit assignment model with an explicit seat allocation process. The model is applicable to a general transit network. A seat allocation model is proposed to estimate the probability of a passenger waiting at a station or on-board to get a seat. The explicit seating model allows a better differentiation of in-vehicle discomfort experienced by sitting and standing passengers. The paper proposes simulation procedures for calculating the sitting probability of each type of passengers. A heuristic solution algorithm for finding an equilibrium solution of the proposed model is developed and tested. The numerical tests show significant influences of the seat allocation model on equilibrium departure time and route choices of passengers. The proposed model is also applied to evaluate the effects of an advanced public transport information system (APTIS) on travellers' decision-making. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ACCESSIBILITY
AB A novel method assessed the quality of bicycle travel throughout a community. Most previous research on the quality of bicycle travel assessed bicycle suitability, that is, the perceived comfort and safety of a linear section of bikeway. Assessment of bikeability (as defined by authors), however, considers comfort and safety of the entire bikeway network for access to important destinations, and there is ample research concerning the related concept of accessibility. A proposed calculation for bikeability was developed on the basis of a common accessibility equation and was demonstrated through a case study of three capital investment scenarios. The analysis used a geographic information system. Engineers and planners can follow a similar procedure to the one used in the calculation development to prioritize improvement projects or to communicate the benefits of new projects.

ID PROXIMITY
AB Dispersion models are useful tools for setting emission control priorities and developing strategies for reducing air toxics emissions. Previous methodologies for modeling hazardous air pollutant emissions for onroad mobile sources are based on using spatial surrogates to allocate county level emissions to grid cells. A disadvantage of this process is that it spreads onroad emissions throughout a grid cell instead of along actual road locations. High local concentrations may be underestimated near major roadways, which are often clustered in urban centers. Here, we describe a methodology which utilizes a Geographic Information System to allocate benzene emissions to major road segments in an urban area and model the segments as elongated area sources. The Industrial Source Complex Short Term dispersion model is run using both gridded and link-based emissions to evaluate the effect of improved spatial allocation of emissions on ambient modeled benzene concentrations. Allocating onroad mobile emissions to road segments improves the agreement between modeled concentrations when compared with monitor observations, and also results in higher estimated concentrations in the urban center.

AB The continuation of the downward trend in the number of injuries arising from road accidents in Britain and the effectiveness of casualty reduction targets are both dependent upon the availability of improved high-quality information. This paper describes the development of, and issues surrounding, an experimental road accident database within a geographical information system (GIS). It highlights ways in which the quality and completeness of road accident data may be improved by providing a separate definition of the road network and considers the benefits of using an object-oriented database system.

DE traffic management; traffic speed; highways
AB Many existing freeway traffic management systems (FTMS) use speed data from loop detectors as input to various traffic management functions, such as automatic incident detection, and to traveler information system components. In many cases, these FTMS include single-loop detectors that are not able to measure vehicle speed. Typically, speed estimates are made on the basis of single-loop traffic volume, occupancy measurements, and estimates of average vehicle length. Unfortunately, the accuracy of these speed estimates is generally very poor. This paper presents a method for improving these speed estimates. The proposed method is applicable to FTMS that contain both single- and dual-loop detector stations. It does not require modification to field hardware or additional field equipment. The proposed method reduces the root mean squared speed estimation error by 23% on average over the traditional speed estimation method of using a constant, average, effective vehicle length for the entire day.

ID PROPAGATION
AB Decentralized traffic information systems based on intervehicle communication have drawn increasing attention in recent years. On the assumption that intervehicle communication is instantaneous relative to vehicle movement, multihop connectivity between two equipped vehicles subject to arbitrary distribution patterns of vehicles, market penetration rates, and transmission ranges is studied. A modeling conceptual framework and definitions are discussed, and a Monte Carlo simulation model of multihop connectivity of instantaneous intervehicle communication systems is presented. With three different, well-chosen random number generators, it is demonstrated that the Monte Carlo simulation model yields results consistent with those in the literature that consider vehicle mobility and that cross-validate analytical models developed previously. The features of the simulation model facilitate determination of the connectivity of large-scale intervehicle communication systems.

AB Active traffic management is the ability to dynamically manage congestion based on prevailing and predicted traffic conditions. Several technologies and algorithms have been employed to develop a set of tools utilised by Traffic Control/Traffic Management Centres with the aim to mitigate disruptions and improve traffic flow in the road networks. One such tool, belonging to the Advanced Traveller Information Systems category is Variable Message Signs. Variable Message Signs are located in major roads and provide real-time traffic information to the drivers so as to modify their behaviour considering the prevailing traffic conditions. To this end, the question arises. Is active traffic management in urban road networks - as currently provided by Variable Message Signs - effective for professional drivers? In plain words, do professional drivers modify their route choice, i.e. divert under the provision of real-time traffic information? A stated preference survey was performed to truck and taxi drivers to identify their response to information provided by Variable Message Signs. Results, in the form of ordered probit models indicated that the provided information is not that relevant to the investigated driver categories, as it is for passenger car drivers.

TI Information sharing during emergency response and recovery - A framework
   for road organizations
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Road organizations are involved in a wide range of emergency response and recovery activities. Information sharing is a critical element in deploying road organization resources during such activities. This paper presents an information-sharing framework for road organizations. On the basis of a study of response and recovery activities, information needs were identified and a geographic information system-based information-sharing framework was created. The framework is applied to a desktop case study in the South Island of New Zealand to establish the magnitude of potential benefits. Results indicate that a reduction in time and cost of emergency response activities could be achieved if the conceptual framework was implemented through reduced response times, faster access to relevant information, and therefore enhanced decision making.

TI Determining Strategic Locations for Environmental Sensor Stations with

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID FACILITY LOCATION; NETWORK
AB Adverse weather leads to more than 1.5 million vehicular crashes, resulting in 800,000 injuries and 7,000 fatalities nationally. The appropriate deployment of roadway weather information systems (RWIS) has been considered an effective strategy to address safety concerns. However, the current practice of selecting the locations of RWIS stations depends primarily on the knowledge and experiences of field operators. Limited research has been conducted on methodologies that can identify RWIS locations systematically on the basis of widely available safety and geographic information system (GIS) data. This paper proposes a spatial optimization method to identify strategic locations for deploying RWIS stations within a large regional transportation network. Weather-related crash data were converted to a safety concern index and then used to examine routes that provided good spatial coverage of the region for optimal locations for RWIS stations through a maximization algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated with crash and GIS data from a tri-county region in Texas with the coverage for each RWIS station assumed to be 10 mi. The resulting locations illustrate the promising potential for the proposed RWIS location optimization algorithm. Additional sensitivity analysis is also conducted with an evaluation of the resulting changes from yearly crash data variations.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
AB Traffic sensors are being deployed widely across the nation, and their data are increasingly being archived for use in multiple applications. However, before the data can be used, it is important to ask whether they can be trusted. That question may be addressed through two basic and important value-added services of a traffic data archive. First, data screening checks the feasibility (i.e., are the data reasonable?) and usability of the data already collected. In the second phase, the health of the detection system is continuously monitored to support proactive maintenance of the sensor infrastructure. This research effort focused on developing a methodology to tailor these functions for specific archives. The paper presents the methodology as well as examples of its application in the regional integrated transportation information system of the Washington, D.C., area.

AB Suppose that in an urban transportation network there is a specific advanced traveler information system (ATIS) which acts for reducing the drivers' travel time uncertainty through provision of pre-trip route information. Because of the imperfect information provided, some travelers are not in compliance with the ATIS advice although equipped with the device. We thus divide all travelers into three groups, one group unequipped with ATIS, another group equipped and in compliance with ATIS advice and the third group equipped but without compliance with the advice. Each traveler makes route choice in a logit-based manner and a stochastic user equilibrium with multiple user classes is reached for every day. In this paper, we propose a model to investigate the evolutions of daily path travel time, daily ATIS compliance rate and yearly ATIS adoption, in which the equilibrium for every day's route choice is kept. The stability of the evolution model is initially analyzed. Numerical results obtained from a test network are presented for demonstrating the model's ability in depicting the day-to-day and year-to-year evolutions.

AB Travellers' en-route path switching is a very common travel adjustment behaviour which can significantly influence the whole day-to-day network traffic flow evolution process. This study encapsulated travellers' sequential path adjustment mechanism into a day-to-day dynamical system, to capture travellers' en-route switching effect without actually building a complicated within-day model to go with. According to different path choice behaviours and traffic information sources, three traveller groups were contained in the dynamical system, including the conservative travellers, the adventurous travellers unequipped with advanced traveller information systems (ATISs) and the ATIS-assisted adventurous travellers. In the proposed day-to-day dynamical model, a fixed point problem was established for achieving the heterogeneous traffic flow caused by travellers' en-route path switching. Some stability analysis of the proposed dynamical system was accomplished in the numerical experiment. The effect of en-route path switching behaviour was investigated and it was found to influence both the stability of the dynamical system and the average travel time of adventurous travellers.

TI Real-time estimation of accident likelihood for safety enhancement
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Unlike conventional traffic safety studies that focused on histrionic data analyses, this study attempts to identify traffic conditions that might lead to a traffic accident from real-time freeway traffic data. An innovative feature of the study is to apply the concept, real-time and preaccident, to accident studies by integrating real-time capabilities in advanced traffic management and information systems (ATMIS). In this study, the traffic conditions leading to more accidents are defined as real-time accident likelihood, and the accident likelihood is estimated by employing a nonparametric Bayesian model. The main goal of the study is to remove hazardous traffic condition prior to accident occurrence by incorporating the real-time accident likelihood into ATMIS. This study estimates real-time accident likelihood from empirical data on I-880 freeway in California, and shows its applicability as an accident precursor.

AB Creating and maintaining up-to-date, sharable, geographic information systems-transportation data are challenging. Many states are working on transportation framework efforts to build a complete, consistent, and current transportation data layer in conjunction with the National Spatial Data Infrastructure and Geospatial One-Stop efforts. An effort was made to systematically reexamine transportation data-sharing, issues as part of the development of a transportation framework for the state of Washington. Business needs were assessed for spatial and temporal accuracy needs of stakeholders and users of a statewide transportation framework. A conceptual model was developed for a transportation framework with emphasis on data flows to update and maintain it and other transportation databases. An update clearinghouse is proposed to collect and disseminate data about new and modified road features. A synthesis of issues is presented, including determining the desired robustness of the transportation framework and cost-allocation principles for possible add-on enhancements.

TI GIS AND NETWORK MODELS - ISSUES FOR 3 POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Geographic Information Systems (GISs) are now being developed for urban transportation planning and modeling. Supporting other recent work, this paper demonstrates the combination of GIS and network-based, urban transportation planning (UTP) modeling software to create powerful tools for the analysis of policies and plans. Following a literature review and informal survey identifying GIS and UTP modeling software in use at transportation agencies, three applications of GIS for network modeling and relevant issues are discussed: 1) developing or modifying UTP models, 2) incorporating network data into a GIS framework, and 3) creating and using a high-speed interactive system suitable for providing near real-time alternatives and policy analysis. Some specific suggestions are made related to the use of two software products, and extensions to other platforms are noted. Conclusions allude to the potential of such systems while realistically pointing to the present difficulties and magnitude of effort that will be required.

TI Use of vehicle signature analysis and lexicographic optimization for
   vehicle reidentification on freeways
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article
DE vehicle reidentification; section measures; lexicographic optimization
AB The vehicle reidentification problem is the task of matching a vehicle detected at one location with the same vehicle detected at another location from a feasible set of candidate vehicles detected at the other location. This paper formulates and solves the vehicle reidentification problem as a lexicographic optimization problem. Lexicographic optimization is a preemptive multi-objective formulation, and this lexicographic optimization formulation combines lexicographic goal programming, classification, and Bayesian analysis techniques. The solution of the vehicle reidentification problem has the potential to yield reliable section measures such as travel times and densities, and enables the measurement of partial dynamic origin/destination demands. Implementation of this approach using conventional surveillance infrastructure permits the development of new algorithms for ATMIS (Advanced Transportation Management and Information Systems). Freeway inductive loop data from SR-24 in Lafayette, California, demonstrates that robust results can be obtained under different traffic flow conditions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Information Impacts on Route Choice and Learning Behavior in a Congested
   Network Experimental Approach
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID PROSPECT-THEORY; DECISION
AB Every traveler makes route choices in an uncertain environment that includes random disruptions to the traffic system such as incidents, bad weather, and random behavior of fellow travelers. The premise underlying the development of advanced traveler information systems that better-informed travelers make better route choices should be tested. This paper studies en route real-time information about the occurrence of an incident and ex post information on forgone payoffs (FPs) (i.e., travel times on nonchosen routes). Data were collected from an interactive experiment in which subjects made multiple rounds of route choices on a hypothetical network subject to random capacity reductions, and travel times were determined by performance functions of route flows from the previous round. En route real-time information increased the network's travel-time savings and reliability under the experimental setting, yet FP information had the opposite effect. The most efficient information structure in terms of travel-time savings is a combination of real-time information and no FP information. Real-time information at downstream nodes encourages participants' strategic behavior at the origin. FP information appears to increase risk-seeking behavior; it encourages route switching without real-time information and suppresses it with real-time information. These results could be valuable for policy evaluations of further developments of advanced traveler information systems.

TI Analysis of Sign Damage and Failure Utah Case Study
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Since the establishment of minimum retroreflectivity levels, agencies and researchers alike have focused on determining the service life of different sheeting type and color combinations. Although deterioration curves and measured retroreflectivity are viable methods for maintaining retroreflectivity compliance, they do not ensure that a traffic sign will convey its intended message. Retroreflectivity efficiency ensures only visibility but does not properly describe the legibility of the sign. In 2011, a data collection effort was conducted by researchers at Utah State University to assess the performance of traffic signs under the Utah Department of Transportation's (DOT) jurisdiction. At its completion, 1,716 traffic signs had been recorded. The researchers determined that the sample sign population was 93% compliant with the minimum retroreflectivity levels. Even though the majority of traffic signs were performing above the minimum retroreflectivity levels, 28% were so damaged that the legibility of the sign could be questioned. Because signs under the Utah DOT's jurisdiction had rates of damage higher than rates of failure, analysis was conducted to determine the contributing factors that led to increased damage rates. Climate and location data were combined with the known location of each traffic sign with the use of geographic information system software. It was determined that average annual precipitation, elevation, seasonal temperature swing, and the exposure of the sign were all contributing factors to higher damage rates.

TI A Kalman Filter Approach for Exploiting Bluetooth Traffic Data When

AB Time-dependent origindestination (OD) matrices are essential input for dynamic traffic models such as microscopic and mesoscopic traffic simulators. Dynamic traffic models also support real-time traffic management decisions, and they are traditionally used in the design and evaluation of advanced traffic traffic management and information systems (ATMS/ATIS). Time-dependent OD estimations are typically based either on Kalman filtering or on bilevel mathematical programming, which can be considered in most cases as ad hoc heuristics. The advent of the new information and communication technologies (ICT) provides new types of traffic data with higher quality and accuracy, which in turn allows new modeling hypotheses that lead to more computationally efficient algorithms. This article presents ad hoc, Kalman filtering procedures that explicitly exploit Bluetooth sensor traffic data, and it reports the numerical results from computational experiments performed at a network test site.

TI GIS-based network routing procedures for overweight and oversized
   vehicles
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The objective of this article is to document the development of an automatic procedure for the routing of overweight vehicles with load-carrying and vertical clearance restrictions for the bridges of a highway network. The use of a network routing procedure within a geographic information system (GIS) operating in a Pc environment is one of the distinctive features of the proposed approach. The procedure automatically identifies all bridges on a specified route and evaluates the adequacy of the bridge structures as well as vertical and horizontal clearance requirements for a given vehicle. A GIS computerized support methodology consistent with the Texas Administrative Code is developed. In particular, the proposed approach uses bridge load formulas to evaluate the adequacy of bridge structures for incoming overloads. Sample runs of the procedure using Texas data indicate that the procedure is computationally efficient.

AB This study intends to empirically verify Jacobs' urban vitality theory, which was based on the observations of her New York City neighborhood in the mid-20th century. To examine the relationship between the residential built environment and walking activity, we used telephone survey data consisting of 1823 valid samples from across Seoul, a city characterized by a high population density and a well-established public transportation system. Respondents were asked questions about their residential location, their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and their walking activities. This study then used geographic information systems to measure objective indicators of built environment variables within 500-meter buffer areas based on the home addresses of the respondents. Then, this study constructed multilevel regression models with walking activity as the dependent variable. Our results indicated that walking activity is associated with Jacobs' six conditions for urban vitality, including land use mix, density, block size, building age, accessibility, and border vacuums.

AB A study quantified the potential benefit of a pretrip, advanced traveler information system (ATIS) to travelers in the Washington, D.C., region for the commuter objective of consistently on-time arrival. Paired driver commutes were simulated with a 15-month archive of regional travel times from SmarTraveler.com, an Internet provider of real-time data on travel time. One driver used a personalized pretrip notification service in selecting departure time and route, while the paired counterpart maintained a habitual trip departure time and route. The pairs' trip arrivals were compared to quantify the effects on time management of a prospective notification service prescribing departure time and route. Approximately 25.9 million paired driver trials were modeled across a network of 55 nodes and 150 links, traversing 711.8 mi of roads in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan region. Trips were simulated for arrivals at 15-min intervals between 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. on workdays from each node to every other node. Overall, regular use of the pretrip ATIS is shown to benefit commuters whose objective is arriving on time. At low levels of ATIS market penetration, routine ATIS use could reduce early arrivals by 56% and late arrivals by 52%. Benefit in vehicle travel time is minimal. By applying a utility function to each trip, it was calculated that ATIS service reduces aggregate travel disutillity by 15%. Approximately 67% of trips (origin-destination) derive a net benefit from routine ATIS use, while 40% benefit by more than $60/year. Benefits are fairly distributed across the year and are generally greatest during the evening peak.

TI Hybrid Work Zone Information System with Portable Changeable Message
   Signs and Dedicated Short-Range Communication
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The future deployment of dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) technology requires that applications with their bases in DSRC be integrated with existing traffic management techniques so that vehicles not equipped with DSRC at the early stage of DSRC deployment can also reap the potential benefits of DSRC technology. A hybrid traffic information system was successfully developed; it combines DSRC technology and portable changeable message signs (PCMSs) for use in the work zone environment to improve traffic mobility and thereby driver safety. The developed system uses DSRC-based vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle communication to acquire travel safety parameters, such as travel time (TT) and the starting location of congestion (SLoC), and to disseminate these parameters to DSRC-equipped vehicles and PCMSs, which are strategically placed along the roadside. Through the use of the DSRC-PCMS interface developed and demonstrated in this work, PCMSs can receive these travel safety parameters from nearby DSRC-equipped vehicles on the road through DSRC-based vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and display them for the drivers of vehicles that lack DSRC capability. Such a system can be useful during the early stage of DSRC deployment when DSRC market penetration is low. In addition, a rigorous analysis was conducted to investigate the minimum DSRC market penetration rate needed for successful functionality of the developed system with respect to both acquisition and dissemination of TT and SLoC. Through the use of a realistic traffic flow model, guidelines were developed to estimate a minimum DSRC penetration rate needed to deploy the developed system for a variety of traffic scenarios on a given work zone road.

AB The procedure used to determine whether performance differences exist among the Ohio Department of Transportation's (ODOT's) 12 districts is presented. Two performance measures were used: pavement condition rating deterioration trends and distributions. The methods used to develop the performance measures from existing pavement data are presented. Five years of actual pavement inspection data were supplied. The study was limited to divided highways with four or more lanes. To develop the deterioration trends, existing data were transformed into a probabilistic deterioration model using geographic information systems and relational database software. Monte Carlo simulation was used to establish deterioration trends and a Markovian deterioration envelope. Hypothesis testing was implemented to determine which districts were performing better or worse than the state as a whole. ODOT's northeastern districts performed worse than the state average, and rural districts performed better than the state average.

AB The accuracy of detector data is paramount for traffic surveillance, control, and information systems, yet little has been published on identifying or correcting errors in the data. This paper presents eight detector validation tests for freeway surveillance using individual vehicle data collected from loop detectors. Five of these tests can be applied to single-loop detectors, while all of them can be applied to dual-loop detectors. The tests are used to contrast the performances of different sensor models, and most of the tests are presented using 24-h blocks of data. In practice, they can also be used to identify permanent and transient hardware problems in other components of the detection system, for example, cross talk between loops or a short in the lead wires. For operational implementation, the tests could be modified to be applied hourly or after a fixed number of vehicles pass. Some of the tests can even be used to "clean up" erroneous measurements.

AB More efficient vehicle routing can improve a firm's competitive advantage or increase the efficiency by which governmental agencies supply public services. More efficient routing call also reduce traffic congestion and air pollution which are growing problems in many urban areas. Unfortunately, the identification of the optimal solution to most vehicle routing problems is computationally intractable. This article presents a user-friendly spatial decision support system (SDSS) to generate vehicle routes for multiple-vehicle routing problems that serve demand located along arcs and at nodes of the transportation network. The SDSS incorporates a geographical information system (GIS) and heuristic solution procedures to generate routes, system-wide data, and maps, as well as individual vehicle route maps, directions, and data quickly. It accommodates realistic system specifics such as vehicle capacity and time constraints and network constraints such as one-way streets, and prohibited turns. The system was tested for trash collection in Coimbra, Portugal. In addition, the SDSS can be used for "what-if" analysis related to possible changes to input parameters such as vehicle capacity and maximum driving time. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Operators and planners of parking guidance and information system (PGIS) often encounter the difficulty when and how to provide parking information to drivers in peak hours. The aim of this study was to assign the parking demands onto the urban network, find the positions suitable to locate the parking variable message sign (parking VMS), and try to solve the problem when to provide parking information to drivers. Parking VMS, as the most common forms of the information display terminal of PGIS, becomes critical in designing PGIS. This paper started from analyzing the relationship between the location and the performances of parking VMS. If a parking VMS is placed right along the link approaching to the divarication intersection of the subsequent shortest path and the previous one, the travel time declines abruptly, and the guiding compliance ratio becomes superior. Then, the network-based parking choice model for the parking VMS was proposed. Network modification and incremental assignment were used to find the divarication intersections caused by the changes of space availability. In addition, MATLAB software package (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) was adopted to calculate the entire process mentioned. The proposed model and the algorithm were applied to a numerical example, where the location of parking VMS was obtained. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Integrating solar photovoltaics in electric vehicles can reduce operating costs and extend the driving range. It is particularly appropriate for urban mobility due to the relatively short typical daily travels of urban vehicles. However, shadowing cast by buildings will reduce the solar irradiation falling on the vehicle, reducing its PV generation. This study assesses the solar potential of onboard solar for roads and urban parking using data in a geographical information system for the case study of Lisbon. Results show that annual losses due to shadowing may reach 25% for roads and over 50% for urban parking spaces. Nevertheless, despite these losses, the annual solar extended range for onboard solar vehicles is between 10 and 18 km/day/kWp, thus significantly reducing charging needs.

AB In-vehicle information systems (IVISs) can enhance or compromise driving safety. Such systems present an array of messages that range from collision warnings and navigation instructions to tire pressure and e-mail alerts. If these messages are not properly managed, the IVIS might fail to provide the driver with critical information, which could undermine safety. In addition, if the IVIS simultaneously presents multiple messages, the driver may fail to attend to the most critical information. To date, only simple algorithms that use priority-based filters have been developed to address this problem. This paper presents a dynamic programming model that goes beyond the immediate relevance and urgency parameters of the current Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) message scheduling algorithm. The resulting algorithm considers the variation of message value over time, which extends the planning horizon and creates a more valuable stream of messages than that based only on the instantaneous message priority. This method has the potential to improve road safety because the most relevant information is displayed to drivers across time and not just the highest priority at any given instant. Applying this algorithm to message sets shows that scheduling that considers the time-based message value, in addition to priority, results in substantially different and potentially better message sequences compared with those based only on message priority. This method can be extended to manage driver workload by adjusting message timing relative to demanding driving maneuvers.

AB Transit operations are interrupted frequently by stochastic variations in traffic and ridership conditions that deteriorate schedule or headway adherence and thus lengthen passenger wait times. Providing passengers with accurate vehicle arrival information through advanced traveler information systems is vital to reducing wait time. Two artificial neural networks (ANNs), trained by link-based and stop-based data, are applied to predict transit arrival times. To improve prediction accuracy, both are integrated with an adaptive algorithm to adapt to the prediction error in real time. The bus arrival times predicted by the ANNs are assessed with the microscopic simulation model CORSIM, which has been calibrated and validated with real-world data collected from route number 39 of the New Jersey Transit Corporation. Results show that the enhanced ANNs outperform the ones without integration of the adaptive algorithm.

AB In the past few decades, travel patterns have become more complex and policy makers demand more detailed information. As a result, conventional data collection methods seem no longer adequate to satisfy all data needs. Travel researchers around the world are currently experimenting with different Global Positioning System (GPS)-based data collection methods. An overview of the literature shows the potential of these methods, especially when algorithms that include spatial data are used to derive trip characteristics from the GPS logs. This article presents an innovative method that combines GPS logs, Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and an interactive web-based validation application. In particular, this approach concentrates on the issue of deriving and validating trip purposes and travel modes, as well as allowing for reliable multi-day data collection. In 2007, this method was used in practice in a large-scale study conducted in the Netherlands. In total, 1104 respondents successfully participated in the one-week survey. The project demonstrated that GPS-based methods now provide reliable multi-day data. In comparison with data from the Dutch Travel Survey, travel mode and trip purpose shares were almost equal while more trips per tour were recorded, which indicates the ability of collecting trips that are missed by paper diary methods.

AB One popular intelligent transportation systems (ITS) element that has been deployed in various areas of the United States is variable-message signs (VMSs). Such signs are part of advanced traveler information systems, and they can help drivers make better en route decisions regarding their trips. Unlike most other ITS elements (e.g., ramp metering, advanced signals), VMSs are not supported by mandatory regulations. Consequently, the expected benefit from implementing VMSs largely depends on the response of drivers. This study explored the factors affecting alternative route choices of car drivers with VMSs on the interstate highway system. This study adopted a method called LOTUS to analyze driver-compliance behavior with VMSs. Driver behavior under information provision through VMS data has been collected using the stated-preference approach. The study showed that travel-time saving is not the single dominant factor for driver route choice under information provision. This article explores variables that are associated with driver compliance.

AB At the planning stages of a highway development process a number of candidate highway alignments are explored. While computerized highway optimization models can seek optimized horizontal and vertical alignments by minimizing aspects of total highway cost, selection of the final alignments is often influenced by environmental impact assessment and public and political participation. In order to ensure that there are no adverse impacts on the environment and the living conditions of the residential community, the Federal Highway Administration has initiated a context-sensitive design approach to highway design. A criteria-based decision support system is developed in this research for selecting highway alignments using genetic algorithms and geographic information systems, which can assist in estimating trade-offs among alignment-sensitive cost, alignment circuity, floodplain and wetland impacts, and intersections with existing highways. A procedure for selecting notably different alignments is proposed by evaluating alignments obtained at intermediate search generations by genetic algorithms. A set of different alignments can provide enough leeway to explore trade-offs among cost and environmental and roadway impacts. An example using Maryland's geographic database is presented.

AB In this paper we propose a stepwise genetic algorithms approach for optimizing highway alignments for improving computational efficiency and quality of solutions. Our previous work in highway alignment optimization has demonstrated that computational burden is a significant issue when working with a geographic information system (GIS) database requiring numerous spatial analyses. For solving real-world problems working directly with real maps through a GIS is highly desirable. Further-more. saving computation time can enhance adoptability of a model especially when a study area is relatively large. or involves many sensitive properties, or if locating complex structures such as intersections. bridges and tunnels is necessary. It is well acknowledged that in many optimization processes subdividing large problems into smaller pieces can decrease the computation time and produce a better solution. In this research two different population sizes are used to develop a stepwise alignment optimization when employing genetic algorithms in suitably subdivided study areas. An example study shows that the proposed stepwise optimization gives more efficient results than the existing methods and also improves quality of solutions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The introduction of intelligent transport systems may affect the driver's ability safely to control the vehicle by distracting him/her from the roadway. These systems must therefore be evaluated to ascertain whether they impose an unreasonable demand on the driver. This paper discusses issues surrounding the use of visual allocation measures for the evaluation of driver information systems in a road trial setting. It explores their value in differentiating between different levels of imposed visual demand. An investigation was made of the visual demand and subjective mental workload resulting from the use of a congestion warning device, an in-car entertainment system and driving without these (the control). The results of the study suggest that the congestion warning device imposed significantly greater visual demand and subjective mental workload than either the in-car entertainment system or the control condition. Difficulties in comparing empirical data with other reported work are highlighted.

AB This paper is aimed at developing a rail transit route optimization model (RTROM) for cost-effective and sustainable rail infrastructure planning and design. Locations of rail transit routes and stations depend on many factors, including potential ridership, costs of land, construction and operation, land use, connecting routes, passenger travel times, and environmental impacts. Suitably located rail transit routes effectively serve the potential demand while also minimizing costs and environmental impacts. Thus, a common problem in all rail infrastructure planning and design projects is to identify the best possible route that satisfies design constraints (such as minimum radius, maximum gradient, and vertical clearance), geographical considerations (such as demand generators and socio-economically sensitive areas) and objectives (such as minimization of associated costs and environmental impacts, or maximization of net benefits). The developed RTROM uses a genetic algorithm for performing optimization, which is integrated to a geographic information system for seamless transfer of land-use, environmental, and topographic data during the optimal search process. The model is tested in a real-world case study from Saint Andrews, Scotland. The lessons learned from the real-world application of the model are discussed. Many extensions of the model remain to be tested in future works.

AB With increasing market penetration, dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) probes are attracting more interest in the advanced traveller information system as a way to efficiently alleviate traffic congestion. Generally, DSRC probes, thanks to their ability to directly collect point-to-point travel time, are considered to be superior to conventional point detectors. However, outlying observations are inevitable in DSRC probe data, and can erroneously indicate abnormally long travel times. In this study, a practical algorithm to filter out outliers in DSRC probe data is proposed. The suggested algorithm is divided into two parts. In the case of small sample, it uses a previous interval value to determine a valid range for current interval values; otherwise, it uses a modified median filter that uses the median and absolute deviation of current interval observations to determine the valid range. The algorithm has been thoroughly verified using various types of DSRC probe data in interrupted and uninterrupted rural highways near Seoul, Korea. Consequently, it was proven to be sufficient to overcome the deficiencies of the previous techniques.

AB Driver assistance and information systems are gaining more and more importance in modern vehicles. In addition to their specific functionalities, these systems also aim to optimise drivers' current strain, because overload as well as underload can increase errors, lead to critical situations and can create furthermore unpleasant experiences for the driver. As workload changes in a highly dynamic way, these systems have to react in a similarly dynamic manner. This requires a fast and dynamically changing estimation of the driver's strain. In recent studies, the author described the relationship among strain changes, driving manoeuvres and environmental factors. In order to further examine this dependency, a simulator study was conducted where traffic densities were varied and strain was measured continuously with the aim to analyse the level and time course of drivers' current strain. Implications for workload adaptive advanced driver assistance systems are discussed.

TI Estimation of Base-Year Floor Space Data Comparison of Census-Based and

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID BUILT FORM
AB Base-year floor space data are essential for integrated land use transport models. This information has traditionally been estimated on the basis of limited population or employment data provided by the census, with unknown accuracy. Advances in geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing technology enable the accuracy of this conventional method to be evaluated with geographic data of high precision. This study assessed the accuracy of the census-based approach in estimating base-year floor space data; the paper describes the use of a hybrid method that combines lidar and geographic vector data (referred to as the "lidar-GIS method") to develop a ground truth building floor space database for the City of Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. A ground survey proved that the developed ground truth building data set provided highly accurate estimates of building heights, footprint areas, and therefore floor space. Through a case study, the floor space at the dissemination area level estimated with the traditional census-based method was compared with the floor space estimated with the lidar-GIS method for various land use categories. The results showed that for the residential floor space estimation, the average absolute percentage error of the census-based approach was 15%. The accuracy of the conventional method was much lower for nonresidential land use categories, with average errors of 50% or higher. These statistics indicate that the traditional census-based approach is unreliable and inaccurate for use in the estimation of base-year floor space and suggests that a method that incorporates the above-mentioned modern information technologies be used.

AB The main purpose of this paper is to develop an efficient method to design traffic analysis zones (TAZs), which is necessary for implementing a planning process with Geographic Information System (GIS) for Transportation (GIS-T), using statistical spatial data analyses and GIS technology. The major roles of GIS in this method are: (1) to produce basic spatial units (BSUs) with topological data structure; (2) to integrate various procedures during the TAZ generation including computer program routines; and (3) to visualize the output of each TAZ generation. One of the most significant reasons for obtaining well-defined TAZs is the fact that they are defined at the outset of transportation demand modeling, used from trip generation to trip assignment, and will ultimately affect transportation policy decisions.
   Toward obtaining well-defined TAZs, this paper concentrates on two important constraints: homogeneity and contiguity. Iterative partitioning technique is adopted to promote the optimum homogeneity of generated TAZs, while a contiguity checking algorithm is developed to ensure contiguous TAZs are generated by the iterative partitioning technique.

AB A road weather information system (RWIS) is a combination of advanced technologies which collect, process, and disseminate road weather and condition information. This information is used by road maintenance authorities to make operative decisions that improve safety and mobility during inclement weather events. Many North American transportation agencies have invested millions of dollars to deploy RWIS stations to improve the monitoring coverage of winter road surface conditions. The design of these networks often varies by region, however, and it is not entirely clear how many stations are necessary to provide adequate monitoring coverage under different conditions; substantial gaps remain in knowledge about optimal design. To fill these gaps, an investigation was conducted to determine how optimized RWIS station densities relate to topographic and weather characteristics. A series of geostatistical semivariogram models were constructed and compared using topographic position index (TPI) and weather severity index (WSI) to measure relative topographic variation and weather severity, respectively. The geostatistical approach was then applied to map the optimum number of RWIS stations across several topographic and weather zones. The study area captured varying environmental characteristics, including regions with flat or varied terrain and warm or cold regions. This study suggests that RWIS data collected from a specific region can be used to estimate the number of stations required for regions with similar zonal characteristics. The outcome of this study can be used as a decision-making tool for RWIS network expansion, thus maximizing monitoring capability of RWIS networks using topographic and weather-related zonal classifications.

TI Graph-Based Modeling of Information Flow Evolution and Propagation under
   V2V Communications-Based Advanced Traveler Information Systems
SO COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB A vehicle equipped with a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications capability can continuously update its knowledge on traffic conditions using its own experience and anonymously obtained travel experience data from other such equipped vehicles without any central coordination. In such a V2V communications-based advanced traveler information system (ATIS), the dynamics of traffic flow and intervehicle communication lead to the time-dependent vehicle knowledge on the traffic network conditions. In this context, this study proposes a graph-based multilayer network framework to model the V2V-based ATIS as a complex system which is composed of three coupled network layers: a physical traffic flow network, and virtual intervehicle communication and information flow networks. To determine the occurrence of V2V communication, the intervehicle communication layer is first constructed using the time-dependent locations of vehicles in the traffic flow layer and intervehicle communication-related constraints. Then an information flow network is constructed based on events in the traffic and intervehicle communication networks. The graph structure of this information flow network enables the efficient tracking of the time-dependent vehicle knowledge of the traffic network conditions using a simple graph-based reverse search algorithm and the storage of the information flow network as a single graph database. Further, the proposed framework provides a retrospective modeling capability to articulate explicitly how information flow evolves and propagates. These capabilities are critical to develop strategies for the rapid flow of useful information and traffic routing to enhance network performance. It also serves as a basic building block for the design of V2V-based route guidance strategies to manage traffic conditions in congested networks. Synthetic experiments are used to compare the graph-based approach to a simulation-based approach, and illustrate both memory usage and computational time efficiencies.

AB Black ice, a thin sheet of glazed ice on a road surface, is hard to spot by drivers, because it usually has the same color as the road. It is very hazardous and causes many car accidents each year. Unfortunately, the current static road warning signs (such as "Ice May Form on Bridge") may not draw enough attention from drivers. In order to provide in-time warning signals during black ice emergencies, this paper proposes a remote-controlled black-ice detection and warning system with economic black ice detection sensors, Geographic Information System (GIS) based database and a remote control server. This system also provides visualization functions to help users locate the affected sites on a digital map.

AB To achieve transport cost reductions and to reduce the environmental impact of road transport, different European countries are allowing or testing longer and heavier vehicles on their road network. In Belgium, the Flanders region started a trial in 2015 allowing a limited number of longer and heavier vehicles on a selection of approved routes. A concern among intermodal operators is however that an allowance of longer and heavier vehicles could trigger a reverse modal shift away from rail and inland waterways container transport. Starting from experiences in other European countries, this paper discusses the potential spatial impact of allowing longer and heavier vehicles on the market areas of intermodal transhipment terminals using a geographic information systems-based location analysis model. In a second step, external transport costs are incorporated in this model, to quantify the spatially diversified societal costs of a potential reverse modal shift. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Implementing intelligent compaction specification on Minnesota TH-64 -
   Synopsis of measurement values, data management, and geostatistical
   analysis
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB An intelligent compaction (IC) specification that required variable feedback amplitude control was recently implemented on the TH-64 reconstruction project in Minnesota. At this site, IC and in situ measurement values were collected to characterize the empirical relationships and variation associated with each measurement value, ultimately to develop a process that better describes the geospatial nature of the data. A geographic information system database was created with IC measurement values and parallel quality assurance data to demonstrate one method for managing large quantities of data. Spatial geostatistics were also examined by using variogram modeling for characterizing uniformity. The findings from this study provide guidance on implementing IC specifications regarding effective use of the technology and some of the challenges that still remain.

TI Log truck transportation an public roads in New Zealand - Regional
   network analysis with geographic information systems
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Industrial forestry within the Southland region of New Zealand is forecast to double over the next 20 years as the availability of wood from production forest plantations increases dramatically. This is generating unprecedented pressure on the public road network. An issue has arisen between goveZment and industry over which should pay for the increasing road upgrading, rehabilitation, and maintenance costs generated by the burgeoning traffic, with the Southland Regional Council proposing a fourfold increase in the road-related rates (tax) charged to the forest industry. In an effort to produce an independent model of the forest industry's use of the road system, regional spatial data sets characterizing the wood supply, demand for wood, and road network were assembled and verified. The transportation geographic information system software package TransCAD was then used to determine the optimum distribution pattern for Southland's wood production. It was confirmed that an accurate model of the current transportation of wood in the region had been created. Distribution patterns under four input scenarios were analyzed. For domestic sawlogs, rearranging supply contracts was predicted to provide transportation savings, measured in annual tonne-kilometers, of just under 40%. On the other hand, there appeared to be no gains to be made in using unconstrained haul routes-the routes in current use are near the optimum. The predictive power of the model was illustrated for the case of chip logs, in which significant changes in traffic patterns were predicted for the 2009 harvest year, along with an order-of-magnitude increase in traffic volumes. The work revealed that the origin of the fourfold rate increase to be charged to forestry is in an arbitrary "perceived damage factor" applied to the numerically modeled traffic flows.

TI Modeling Nonmotorized Travel Demand at Intersections in Calgary, Canada
   Use of Traffic Counts and Geographic Information System Data
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB In September 2009, the City Council of Calgary, Canada, approved Plan It Calgary, which proposed policies that focused on the development of resilient neighborhoods through the intensification and diversification of urban activities around transit stations and routes. More intensive development and mixed land use encourage nonmotorized trips and reinforce comfortable, safe, and walkable streets. The development of high-density, mixed-use, and transit- and pedestrian-oriented communities has the potential to generate shorter trips to destinations; these trips are expected to result in a higher share of active travel modes, such as biking and walking. Thus, there is a growing need to estimate the impact of land use development scenarios and transportation policies on bicycle and pedestrian demand to predict nonmotorized trip volumes and design the related infrastructure adequately. In this study, on the basis of multiple linear and Poisson regression models were calibrated to estimate nonmotorized travel demand on the basis of geographic information system data, transportation services, and road characteristics. The empirical models developed in this research can be used to assess the impacts of urban design and built environments, such as development of high-density and mixed land use areas, of complete street construction in the middle ring communities of Calgary, and of influenced demand for active travel modes. The developed models also show the benefits of improved pedestrian infrastructure, such as improved network connectivity and increases in the length of pedestrian pathways, as well as the benefits of the integration of transit and walking modes and transit and bicycle modes in encouraging more nonmotorized travel demand. This method is a straightforward statistical analysis for practitioners, and the needed data are relatively easy to access.

AB This paper examines a case study of the SkyCabs system as a way to alleviate some of the traffic problems of Auckland, New Zealand. SkyCabs is an elevated two-way monobeam carrying light eight-seater cabs on tracks on each side of the beam, available on demand, providing fast, pollution-free, unimpeded travel above the footpath with panoramic views of the city. The aim of this study is to investigate the attractiveness of implementing the SkyCabs system to and from Auckland central business district (CBD) and Auckland international airport by examining four variables: different routes, different number of stops/stations, different passenger demand levels, and different number of cabs in the system. The analysis utilizes geographical information system and simulation tools for the various scenarios considered. The results show that it is possible to assess the cost-benefit of alternative routes in terms of those four variables and rate of return on investment.

ID VIRTUAL-REALITY
AB A project that uses a real-time web-based visualization approach for environmental modeling by integrating a geographic information system (GIS) with virtual reality modeling language and Java was explored. A new technique, the server push approach, is developed to "push" only up-to-date data from the remote server to the client and consequently reduce network traffic across the Internet. A fat client model is adopted to host the GIS environmental data model on the Internet. Online data hosting boosts interactivity, swift and transparent communication, user access, and cost-efficiency. These data can be analyzed online by using a GIS and the numerical functions embedded in Web3D-based Java applets. The spatially distributed GIS-based model used to generate data on catchment hydrology and runoff (the topography-based hydrological model; TOPMODEL) accepts incoming information and facilitates real-time simulation.

ID PROBE DATA; VARIABILITY; DELAY
AB Arterial travel time information is crucial to advanced traffic management systems and advanced traveler information systems. An effective way to represent this information is the estimation of travel time distribution. In this paper, we develop a modified Gaussian mixture model in order to estimate link travel time distributions along arterial with signalized intersections. The proposed model is applicable to traffic data from either fixed-location sensors or mobile sensors. The model performance is validated using real-world traffic data (more than 1,400 vehicles) collected by the wireless magnetic sensors and digital image recognition in the field. The proposed model shows high potential (i.e., the correction rate are above 0.9) to satisfactorily estimate travel time statistics and classify vehicle stop versus non-stop movements. In addition, the resultant movement classification application can significantly improve the estimation of traffic-related energy and emissions along arterial.

AB This paper describes the development of a systematic methodology for identifying and ranking bottlenecks using probe data collected by commercial global positioning system fleet management devices mounted on trucks. These data are processed in a geographic information system and assigned to a roadway network to provide performance measures for individual segments. The authors hypothesized that truck speed distributions on these segments can be represented by either a unimodal or bimodal probability density function and proposed a new reliability measure for evaluating roadway performance. Travel performance was classified into three categories: unreliable, reliably fast, and reliably slow. A mixture of two Gaussian distributions was identified as the best fit for the overall distribution of truck speed data. Roadway bottlenecks were ranked on the basis of both the reliability and congestion measurements. The method was used to evaluate the performance of Washington state roadway segments, and proved efficient at identifying and ranking truck bottlenecks. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000444.

AB This paper presents a Real-time Traveler Information System (RTIS) For Hong Kong, in which a novel Solution algorithm is proposed for estimation of both the current and instantaneous travel times using automatic vehicle identification (AVI) data. The proposed algorithm also deduces the travel times on the other road links without real-time AVI data. By integration of the filtered real-time and off-line database together, the RTIS can provide area-wide traffic information in the whole network of Hong Kong. The travel time estimates arc updated once ever, five minutes in the RTIS. Observation surveys are conducted during different time periods at a selected path in Hong Kong urban area to validate the RTIS travel time estimates. With the use of the same set of observation data, comparison is also given to the estimation results of the other three existing AVI travel time estimation algorithms: TransGuide, TranStar and Transmit algorithms in US. It was found that the proposed RTIS algorithm Could generate the Current travel time estimates for the three Study periods with the minimum absolute errors and absolute percentage errors. The estimations of instantaneous travel times oil the road sections with and without real-time AVI data have also been illustrated. The validation results show, that the performance of RTIS is satisfactory and acceptable.

AB State Transportation Departments nationwide manage huge amounts of information. Examples include geometric plans, sign inventories, maintenance records, engineering studies, and so on, In many cases, no indexing or archiving system is available for storing and retrieving this data. A prototype computer-based model was developed in order to address these indexing needs. The model focuses on engineering report tracking but can be extended to accommodate other types of information. The model is based on a procedure that links signalized intersections and road segments to nonspatial attribute data in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. A paper form was developed in order to facilitate the extraction of data from engineering reports. The indexing model also includes a computerized version of the paper form to assist in data entry, and another form for query purposes. The indexing model was applied to 10 years of engineering report data from East Baton Rouge Parish, La.

AB When driving a vehicle, the driver must allocate adequate attention to the demands of driving in order to be safe. Based on analyses of vehicle data, driving environment data, and videos of the road ahead, a driving task demand prediction model based on real-time road traffic data was established in this study. Assessments of driving task demands allowed for the validation of this model. In addition, intervention strategies were proposed for distractions from in-vehicle secondary tasks at different levels of demand. The analysis showed that at a high driving task demand, the control of all in-vehicle information systems (IVIS), except for the playing of radio or CD, should be warned against or forbidden. Meanwhile, distractions from secondary tasks originated from 91% of the in-vehicle foreign objects, and 67% of the in-vehicle facilities can be avoided by formulating precaution strategies. This study provides methods and technical support for the management of driver distraction precaution.

AB The authors describe the development and application of a single, integrated digital representation of a multimodal and transcontinental freight transportation network. The network was constructed to support the simulation of some five million origin to destination freight shipments reported as part of the 1997 United States Commodity Flow Survey. The paper focuses on the routing of the tens of thousands of intermodal freight movements reported in this survey. Routings involve different combinations of truck, rail and water transportation. Geographic information systems (GIS) technology was invaluable in the cost-effective construction and maintenance of this network and in the subsequent validation of mode sequences and route selections. However, computationally efficient routing of internodal freight shipments was found to be most efficiently accomplished outside the GIS. Selection of appropriate intermodal routes required procedures for linking freight origins and destinations to the transportation network, procedures for modeling intermodal terminal transfers and inter-carrier interlining practices, and a procedure for generating multimodal impedance functions to reflect the relative costs of alternative, survey reported mode sequences.

AB Travel time is a fundamental measure in transportation. Accurate travel-time prediction also is crucial to the development of intelligent transportation systems and advanced traveler information systems. In this paper, we apply support vector regression (SVR) for travel-time prediction and compare its results to other baseline travel-time prediction methods using real highway traffic data. Since support vector machines have greater generalization ability and guarantee global minima for given training data, it is believed that SVR will perform well for time series analysis. Compared to other baseline predictors, our results show that the SVR predictor can significantly reduce both relative mean errors and root-mean-squared errors of predicted travel times. We demonstrate the feasibility of applying SVR in travel-time prediction and prove that SVR is applicable and performs well for traffic data analysis.

AB Variable message signs (VMS) are programmable traffic control devices that convey nonpersonalized real-time information on network traffic conditions to drivers encountering them. Especially useful under incidents, VMS aim to influence driver routing decisions to enhance network performance. This study investigates the effect of different message contents on driver response under VMS. Presumably, if the message content is a significant factor in driver response, the traffic controller can use it as a control variable to influence network traffic conditions positively without compromising the integrity of information. This issue is addressed through an on-site stated preference user survey. Logit models are developed for drivers' diversion decisions. The analysis suggests that content in terms of the level of detail of relevant information significantly affects drivers' willingness to divert. Other significant factors include socioeconomic characteristics, network spatial knowledge, and confidence in the displayed information. Results also indicate differences in the response attitudes of semitrailer truck drivers compared to other travelers. They provide substantive insights for the design and operation of VMS-based information systems.

TI EFFECT OF TRAFFIC INFORMATION ON COMMUTERS PROPENSITY TO CHANGE ROUTE
   AND DEPARTURE TIME
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION

ID FLEXIBILITY; SYSTEMS
AB Considerable public and private resources are devoted to the collection and dissemination of real-time traffic information in the Chicago area. Such information is intended to help individuals make more informed travel decisions, yet its effect on behavior remains largely unexplored. This study evaluates the effect of traffic information on travelers' route and departure time changes and provides a stronger basis for developing advanced information systems.
   Downtown Chicago automobile commuters were surveyed during the AM peak period. The results indicate that a majority of the respondents access, use and respond to information. For example, individuals use travel information to reduce their anxiety - even if they do not change travel decisions; this indicates that information may have ''intrinsic'' value. That is, simply knowing traffic conditions is valued by travelers. More than 60% of the respondents had used traffic information to modify their travel decisions. Multivariate analysis using the ordered probit model showed that individuals were more likely to use traffic reports for their route changes if they perceived traffic reports to be accurate and timely, and frequently listened to traffic reports. Respondents were more likely to change their departure times if they perceived traffic reports to be accurate and relevant, and frequently listened to traffic reports.
   The implication for Advanced Traveler Information Systems are that they may be designed to support both enroute and pre-trip decisions. ATIS performance, measured in terms of accuracy, relevance and timeliness would be critical in the success of such systems. Further, near-term prediction of traffic conditions on congested and unreliable routes (where conditions change rapidly) and incident durations is desirable.

AB Economic theory suggests that the use of more expensive low-sulphur fuel within an Emission Control Area (ECA) should result in lower vessel speeds. The objective of this paper is to investigate empirically, for the first time, whether the introduction of an ECA affects vessel speeds. We utilize a dataset of observed vessel speeds derived from the Automated Information System (AIS) for nearly 7000 ECA boundary crossings over a three-year period. Our results suggest that introducing stricter sulphur regulations inside the North Sea ECA from 1. January 2015 did not affect vessel speeds once changes in macroeconomic conditions are accounted for. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports an effort to estimate potential benefits of Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) by combing regional travel demand and microscopic simulation models. The approach incorporates dynamic features not yet available in the commercial software market. The suggested technique employs data that are readily available to most urban planning organizations, and is straightforward in its application. The key reported measure of effectiveness is corridor and local system delay, and is sensitive to both the level of penetration of traveler information and the pre-trip and en-route choices drivers make based on this information. The technique is demonstrated on an urban freeway corridor in a medium sized mid-west city.

AB This study models and evaluates the accessibility to public transit and public transit equity by integrating the general transit feed specification (GTFS) data. A transit gap index (TGI) and a geographic information system (GIS)-based methodology are developed to conduct the assessment. The TGI is developed by taking into consideration demographic features, as well as spatial and temporal transit service characteristics. A case study in the city of Charlotte is conducted and a comprehensive gap analysis based on the proposed methodology is performed. Results show that the transit supply provides higher service coverages in the central business district of Charlotte and decreases as the distance to downtown Charlotte increases. Most of the identified transit-dependent areas are suburban and rural communities located on the fringe of the city. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to examine the impact of different walking distances on transit gaps. Guidelines are developed and best-practice recommendations for the use of GTFS data as a main data source are made to better understand and assess public transit equity and accessibility for public transportation planning and operation. Several policy implications are also drawn in terms of enhancing the public transit system equity and accessibility.

TI Safety Assessment of the Integration of Road Weather Information Systems
   and Variable Message Signs in British Columbia
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Adverse weather conditions create an environment in which it is difficult for drivers to navigate safely. Reducing weather-related collisions is a target for road safety professionals in British Columbia (BC), Canada. This study reports the safety benefits of installing road weather information systems (RWISs) coupled with variable message signs (VMSs) on provincial rural highways in BC. The RWIS/VMS system comprises road and weather sensors, as well as two VMSs. The road and weather sensors collect data on pavement surfaces and weather conditions. Information on adverse road/weather conditions are conveyed to road users via the VMSs. The system had been installed at six different locations on rural undivided highways in BC between 2011 and 2014. The analysis made use of police-attended serious crashes (i.e., fatal + injury) that took place during winter seasons. Depending on the implementation date, three or four winter seasons were available as a before-implementation period, while three to six winter seasons were available as an after-implementation period. An Empirical Bayes (EB) approach was employed to ensure that the evaluation results were reliable and to account for the regression-tothe-mean artifact. Safety performance functions (SPFs) were developed using data collected at similar sites. The EB evaluation results showed an overall statistically significant reduction of 32.7% in all winter serious collisions (WSC). An economic evaluation showed that the systems led to a benefit-cost ratio of 4.8 and an overall net present value of more than Can$ 12 million. The results of this study may motivate transportation agencies and stakeholders to pursue similar systems for mitigating weather-related safety problems.

DE hybrid vehicles; predictive control; stochastic optimal control
AB The potential for reduced fuel consumption of hybrid electric vehicles by the use of predictive powertrain control was assessed on measured-drive data from an urban route with varying topography. The assessment was done by evaluating the fuel consumption using three optimal controllers, each with a different level of information access to the driven route. The lowest information case represents that the vehicle knows that it is being driven in a certain environment, e.g., city driving, and that the controller has been optimized for that type of environment. The second highest information level, represents a vehicle equipped with a GPS combined with a traffic-flow information system. In the highest information level, the future power demand is completely known to the control system, hence, the corresponding optimal controller results in the minimal attainable fuel consumption. This paper showed that good performance (1%-3% from the minimal attainable fuel consumption) can be achieved with the lowest information case, with a time-invariant controller that is optimized to the environment. The second highest information level results in less than 0.2% higher consumption than the minimal attainable on the studied route. This means that it is possible to design a predictive controller based on information supplied by the vehicle-navigation system and traffic-flow-information systems that can come very close to the minimal attainable fuel consumption. A novel algorithm that uses information supplied by the vehicle-navigation system was presented. The proposed algorithm results in a consumption only 0.3% from the minimal attainable consumption on the studied route.

AB This study investigated the benefits and costs of commonly used thin surface treatments for maintenance of bituminous pavements in Kansas. Cost and performance data were collected from the Kansas Pavement Management Information System for all treatments applied from 1992 to 2006. Results show that seal coats have a short average service life on Interstate highways. The average life on non-Interstate highways is about 4 years. This life is slightly lower than that for other thin surface treatments, including hot-mix asphalt (HMA) overlays. Seal coats also have a significantly lower equivalent uniform annual cost than do all other thin surface treatments in Kansas. A comparison of pavement benefit values before and after application showed that seal coat could not mitigate distresses better than other methods, especially thin HMA overlays. However, its performance is quite similar to that of the modified slurry seal.

AB People riding transit in the city of Detroit walk on average 0.8 miles (1.3 km) per round trip. The straight-line walking distance was found by buffering the bus stop locations and comparing them to the weighted US Census blocks. However, the true walking path follows the street pattern. Rather than undertaking network analysis, which would require connecting all addresses in the city with all bus stops, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed in geographic information system with random addresses. The simulation was performed over several addresses until convergence was achieved. The distances were converted to walking times and compared to the US National Household Transportation Survey.

AB Bus timetables with even headways often require passengers to adjust to given timetables instead of adjusting the timetables to fluctuating passenger demand. This expectation is a main source of unreliable service that extends passenger waiting times at bus stops and creates overcrowding. Alternative transit timetables are created to improve the correspondence of vehicle departure times with passenger demand while minimizing resources (number of buses required). An automated method is presented. With the growing problems of transit reliability, and the advance in the technology of passenger information systems, even and clock headways become less important. Therefore, more efficient schedules from both the passenger and operator perspectives can be realized. The method presented uses an informative graphic technique. This approach enables the scheduler to examine changes in bus departure times and to obtain immediate feedback on the expected average passenger loads.

AB The demand for mental health services has been growing stronger over the last couple of decades. This indicates the need to study and assess the access to these mental health services especially with a focus on the vulnerable populations having the greatest need. As such, this paper presents a Geographical Information Systems (GIS)-based analysis in order to study and evaluate the accessibility of mental health facilities using the information on the spatial distributions of population and facilities, and regional traffic characteristics. For this purpose, different age group segments are utilized including the total population as well as those aged between 18 and 21, 22 and 49, 50 and 64, and those aged over 65 and 85. Focusing on the State of Florida, spatially detailed accessibility metrics are calculated with regard to healthcare facilities using travel times between population block groups and these critical mental health facilities. These estimates are used to calculate the weighted county accessibility scores for each county. Findings clearly delineate those counties that lack access to mental facilities, especially those in Northwest Florida, a demographically diverse and substantially rural region. This type of analysis can help planners and policy makers develop better strategies in order to provide adequate mental health care options needed in targeted locations.

AB Maneuvering vessel detection and tracking (VDT), incorporated with state estimation and trajectory prediction, are important tasks for vessel navigational systems (VNSs), as well as vessel traffic monitoring and information systems (VTMISs) to improve maritime safety and security in ocean navigation. Although conventional VNSs and VTMISs are equipped with maritime surveillance systems for the same purpose, intelligent capabilities for vessel detection, tracking, state estimation, and navigational trajectory prediction are underdeveloped. Therefore, the integration of intelligent features into VTMISs is proposed in this paper. The first part of this paper is focused on detecting and tracking of a multiple-vessel situation. An artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed as the mechanism for detecting and tracking multiple vessels. In the second part of this paper, vessel state estimation and navigational trajectory prediction of a single-vessel situation are considered. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is proposed for the estimation of vessel states and further used for the prediction of vessel trajectories. Finally, the proposed VTMIS is simulated, and successful simulation results are presented in this paper.

AB Link travel times are crucial for advanced traveler information systems and traffic management applications. However, current systems for estimating them still have shortcomings that need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for vehicle reidentification via signature matching using signal processing techniques and a travel time estimation algorithm that is robust to potential (and often inevitable) vehicle misidentifications. Individual vehicles are matched between well-separated stations in a road transportation network using signatures captured by embedded roadway sensors. Statistical and multirate signal processing methods are used to develop data-postprocessing algorithms that are critical to the subsequent signature-matching problem, which is formulated using optimal techniques from communication theory. A probabilistic modeling of the generated matching assignments and an unsupervised data-clustering technique are then used to devise a travel time estimation algorithm. The proposed method is tested under a real traffic scenario, and accurate link travel time measures are reported.

AB Each year, thousands of new utilities are installed within the rights-of-way (ROWS) of highway facilities nationwide. With the proliferation of utilities within their ROWs, it is becoming increasingly difficult for transportation agencies not only to allow more utilities but also to deliver and manage their own transportation systems in a timely and efficient manner. A geographically referenced prototype model that ties the locations of utility facilities to a state highway network and that associates the positional data with details of utility facility ownership, service or commodity type, infrastructure size, material, and other pertinent characteristics is described. The inventory model can accommodate a variety of utility-related processes within a transportation agency, including utility permits, joint use agreements, and deliverables from subsurface utility engineering contracts. Common sources of utility facility data at a transportation agency are reviewed, and a geographic information system model that represents the locations of utility facilities within the highway ROW is described.

TI Highway Travel Time Prediction of Segments Based on ANPR Data
   considering Traffic Diversion
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID NETWORKS; MODELS
AB Travel time is one of the most critical parameters in proactive traffic management and the deployment of advanced traveler information systems. This paper proposes a hybrid model named LSTM-CNN for predicting the travel time of highways by integrating the long short-term memory (LSTM) and the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the attention mechanism and the residual network. The highway is divided into multiple segments by considering the traffic diversion and the relative location of automatic number plate recognition (ANPR). There are four steps in this hybrid approach. First, the average travel time of each segment in each interval is calculated from ANPR and fed into LSTM in the form of a multidimensional array. Second, the attention mechanism is adopted to combine the hidden layer of LSTM with dynamic temporal weights. Third, the residual network is introduced to increase the network depth and overcome the vanishing gradient problem, which consists of three pairs of one-dimensional convolutional layers (Conv1D) and batch normalization (BatchNorm) with the rectified linear unit (ReLU) as the activation function. Finally, a series of Conv1D layers is connected to extract features further and reduce dimensionality. The proposed LSTM-CNN approach is tested on the three-month ANPR data of a real-world 39.25 km highway with four pairs of ANPR detectors of the uplink and downlink, Zhejiang, China. The experimental results indicate that LSTM-CNN learns spatial, temporal, and depth information better than the state-of-the-art traffic forecasting models, so LSTM-CNN can predict more accurate travel time. Moreover, LSTM-CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in nonrecurrent prediction, multistep-ahead prediction, and long-term prediction. LSTM-CNN is a promising model with scalability and portability for highway traffic prediction and can be further extended to improve the performance of the advanced traffic management system (ATMS) and advanced traffic information system (ATIS).

DT Article
AB This paper presents current efforts at the Technical University of Denmark for developing concepts for a Geographic Information System for the whole traffic planning process. Such a system (GIS-T) will consist of five model for collection of data, determination of alternate solutions, estimation of future traffic flows, impact analyses and selection of a solution. Furthermore, the system will contain procedures for evaluation and quality control of data and results. Such an integrated GIS-T system will not only ease the specific work, but also gather and strengthen the process of traffic planning.
   The paper deals mainly with conceptual problems. The theoretical discussions, however, are supplemented by practical examples of traffic models, models for impact analyses and models for data management and quality control, which were implemented in GIS and tested on several real size problems in Denmark. The final. part of the paper outlines the promising perspective of future work with GIS-T.

AB This paper presents results from a research case study that examined the distribution of travel time of origin-destination (OD) pairs on a transportation network under incident conditions. Using a transportation simulation dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model, incident on a transportation network is executed under normal conditions, incident conditions without traveler information availability, and incident conditions assuming that users had perfect knowledge of the incident conditions and could select paths to avoid the incident location. The results suggest that incidents have a different impact on different OD pairs. The results confirm that an effective traveler information system has the potential to ease the impacts of incident conditions network wide. Yet it is also important to note that the use of information may detriment some OD pairs while benefiting other OD pairs. The methodology demonstrated in this paper provides insights into the usefulness of embedding a fully calibrated DTA model into the analysis tools of a traffic management and information center.

TI Structure of Port Operations Observatory Application in Mediterranean

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The main objectives of the monitoring strategy of transportation services and infrastructure at the national, regional, and international levels are to learn from experience, to develop alternative management approaches, and to modify policy regulations to optimize the level of service and use of existing infrastructure. The transportation infrastructure observatories are public or private entities devoted not only to generating statistics but also to collecting and harmonizing transportation data in standardized information systems to support performance-based management of transportation services planning and delivery. An observatory can be a web portal for strategic information and up-to-date reports on relevant inquiries, examining one or more transportation modes in a specific geographical area. This paper provides guidelines for developing the basic structure with the static and dynamic contents of an observatory of port operations, as well as its web-based architecture and functioning. The guidelines include the definition and classification of its key features and users, and the technological requirements of the website architecture. For demonstration purposes, an application is presented for a port operations observatory in the Mediterranean Sea.

AB Variable message signs - which comprise a type of advanced traveller information systems - can affect driver behaviour, especially considering route choice. Hence, their operation is integrated in traffic management strategies for the mitigation of traffic congestion. This research explores the factors determining driver response to variable message signs (VMSs) in the city of Athens. A stated preference questionnaire survey is undertaken and discrete choice analysis is performed towards this aim. More specifically, a random-effect ordered probit model is estimated that provides insight on the contributory factors that influence driver propensity to divert, when provided with information on incident occurrence via VMSs. Message characteristics, that is, incident type, impact and suggestion for an alternative route, trip characteristics, such as vehicle type, as well as, driver characteristics, such as driver age and income, have been found to affect driver behaviour. Furthermore, appropriate models are also estimated for subsets of the driving population (considering gender and age) and specific similarities and differences between the population behaviours are identified.

TI Optimization of Rail Transit Alignments Considering Vehicle Dynamics
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

ID HIGHWAY ALIGNMENT; MODEL; ROUTES; COST
AB Urban rail transit systems are being extended throughout the world because of their large capacities, avoidance of traffic congestion, and environmental advantages. Various optimization models can help design rail transit alignments satisfying various track geometry constraints, but none of these models can account for the impacts of vehicle dynamics on operational and user costs. This paper presents a practical rail transit alignment optimization method for designing track alignments that accounts for vehicle dynamics. The method can generate alignments that improve the balance between the initial cost and the operation and user costs recurring throughout the system's life cycle. A heuristic based on a genetic algorithm is developed to search for solutions efficiently while interacting with the supporting geographic information system. A hypothetical topography scenario is created to illustrate the impact of vehicle dynamics on the trade-offs among system costs. The Baltimore, Maryland, Red Line is used as a case study to demonstrate that the model can find good solutions in regions with complex topographies.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID AT-FAULT CRASHES; ACCIDENTS; ROADWAYS
AB Pedestrian-vehicle crashes are more likely to result in severe pedestrian incapacitating injuries and fatalities than other types of crashes. In this study, mixed logit models are developed to investigate and identify significant contributing factors to the pedestrian injury severity in pedestrian-vehicle crashes in both rural and urban areas in North Carolina, United States. Pedestrian-vehicle crash data from the Highway Safety Information System database from 2005 to 2012 are collected and used in this study. Crash injury severities are classified into five categories: fatality; injury class 1 (disabling injury); injury class 2 (evident injury); injury class 3 (possible injury); and no injury (property damage only). The estimation results show that factors such as a bad driver's physical condition, heavy trucks, dark light condition, speed limit between 35 and 50mph and speed limit above 50mph will significantly increase pedestrian injury severities in both rural and urban areas. The developed model and analysis results provide insights on developing effective countermeasures to reduce pedestrian injury severities in pedestrian-vehicle crashes and improve traffic system safety performance.

AB This paper focuses on modeling agents' en-route diversion behavior under information provision. The behavior model is estimated based on naive Bayes rules and re-calibrated using a Bayesian approach. Stated-preference driving simulator data is employed for model estimation. Bluetooth-based field data is employed for re-calibration. Then the behavior model is integrated with a simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model. A traffic incident scenario along with variable message signs (VMS) is designed and analyzed under the context of a real-world large-scale transportation network to demonstrate the integrated model and the impact of drivers' dynamic en-route diversion behavior on network performance. Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) is employed as a measurement to represent traffic dynamics. This research has quantitatively evaluated the impact of information provision and en-route diversion in a VMS case study. It proposes and demonstrates an original, complete, behaviorally sound, and cost-effective modeling framework for potential analyses and evaluations related to Advanced Traffic Information System (ATIS) and real-time operational applications.

AB This paper presents a study of the predictability of bus usage based on massive bus ride data collected from Lisbon, Portugal. An understanding of public bus usage behavior is important for future development of personalized transport information systems that are equipped with proactive capabilities such as predictive travel recommender systems. In this study, we show that there exists a regularity in the bus usage and that daily bus rides can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy. In addition, we show that there are spatial and temporal factors that influence bus usage predictability. These influential factors include bus usage frequency, number of different bus lines and stops used, and time of rides.

TI Assessing the Agreement among Pavement Condition Indexes
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE

DE Pavement management; Transportation asset management; Condition
   assessment; Pavement performance
AB Pavement condition indexes are numerical indicators of the structural and material integrity of a pavement. Because these indexes appear to be similar (essentially a 0-100 scale, with 100 indicating ideal condition), it can be tempting to use different indexes for comparing the performance of pavement networks in different states or jurisdictions within a state. To ascertain the level of agreement among these condition indexes, six pavement condition indexes from five DOTs in the United States are discussed and compared using distress and ride quality data obtained from the Pavement Management Information System of the Texas Department of Transportation. The computed scores were compared visually (using scatter plots) and statistically (using paired t-test). The results provide empirical evidence that there are significant differences among seemingly similar pavement condition indexes.

AB Industrial forestry activities in New Zealand are now in a phase of unprecedented growth: the annual cut will double from 18 million m(3) to well over 30 million m(3) a year during the next 5 years. Given that most of the wood is taken from forest to mill or port by road in New Zealand, including a portion of the trip on public highways, the impacts of the doubling in logging truck traffic will be significant and severe. New Zealand's roads have, for the most part, thin-sealed, unbound pavements. New Zealand's second-largest industrial sector is tourism. Pavements and tourists will feel the impact of the looming increase in logging truck traffic unless steps are taken to anticipate the changes in traffic volumes and patterns. There is the complicating factor that the dairy industry too is now expanding rapidly with associated increases in raw milk tanker traffic. There is some friction between the forest industry and the dairy industry over which will be responsible for the increased strengthening, rehabilitation, and maintenance of roads. Research is under way to use regional network analysis and geographic information systems to predict the increases in heavy-truck traffic and changes in its distribution on public roads. This is the first step toward devising measures to mitigate the impacts and is a precursor to the implementation of pavement management. A unique opportunity exists in southern New Zealand: cooperation between forest operators and government agencies in the Otago and Southland region of the South Island of New Zealand on large-scale projects, providing the environment needed to examine such large, landscape-scale problems.

TI Estimating Current and Potential Bicycle Use for Statewide Planning
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB As interest in bicycling for transportation and recreation has increased, state transportation agencies and other planning organizations must prioritize ways in which to spend their limited resources. This paper describes a geographic information system based analysis that categorizes state-owned highways across Vermont on the basis of potential bicycle use through the leverage of readily available data. This methodology allows a planning agency to make decisions on the basis of statewide information and avoids the costs of a traditional travel demand model. It informs decision makers about where to invest additional funds to improve on-road bicycle facilities and to prioritize maintenance to maximize value. It also provides the groundwork for bicycle-related performance standards and to identify critical gaps in high-demand bicycle corridors.

AB A model of driver's route choice behavior under advanced traveler information system (ATIS) is developed based on data collected from learning experiments using interactive computer simulation. The experiment subjected drivers to 32 simulated days in which they were to choose between the freeway or a side road. A neural network model is used as a convenient modeling technique in this initial phase of the analysis. The results indicated that most subjects made route choices based mainly on their recent experiences. It was also demonstrated that route choice behaviors are related to the personal characteristics as well as the characteristics of the respective routes. Travel experiences have less effect on the choice of the side road compared to the freeway and the results indicate that the prediction accuracy of the model, the acceptance rate of advice, and the quality of advice are closely correlated. The model developed here was for advice consistently provided at a level of 75 percent accuracy. The paper concludes with a discussion of experimental limitations and suggestions for future research.

AB The corridor simulator (CORSENI)-based microscopic program, which can simulate realistic bus operations, has been enhanced with some newly developed features; these are validated. Transit operations-related data for New Jersey Transit Bus Route 39 were collected to assess the reliability of the enhanced CORSIM program. On the basis of the mean average percentage error and the root mean square error, this study demonstrated that simulation output can represent realistic bus operations, such as the disruptions of transit headways caused by ridership fluctuations at bus stops and delays at intersections. The proposed program provides a potential basis for evaluating advanced transit management and control strategies and real-time transit traveler information systems in the advent of advanced public transportation systems.

AB Traffic speed is one of the basic variables that indicates the level of service of a road entity. It plays an essential role in transportation planning and management. This study attempts to establish a prediction model for speed distribution, in terms of average travel speed and standard deviation, using probe vehicle data in Hong Kong. Taking advantage of detailed traffic flow data obtained from the annual traffic census, a comprehensive traffic information database can be established using the geographical information system technique. The effects of traffic flow, road geometry, and weather conditions on speed distribution are determined using the Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation approach full Bayesian method.

AB Analyzing the distance visible to a driver on the highway is important for traffic safety, especially in maneuvers such as emergency stops, when passing another vehicle or when vehicles cross at intersections. This analysis is necessary not only in the design phase of highways, but also when they are in service. For its use in this last phase, a procedure supported by a Geographic Information System (GIS) has been implemented that determines the highway distances visible to the driver. The use of a GIS allows the sight distance analysis to be integrated with other analyses related to traffic safety, such as crash and design consistency analyses. In this way, more complete analyses could be made and costs shared. Additionally, with the procedure proposed it is possible to use data regarding the trajectory of a vehicle obtained on a highway with a Global Positioning System (GPS) device. This application is very useful when highway design data are not available. The procedure developed and its application in a case study are presented in this article. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

With this type of navigation, road signs are directly superimposed onto the video of the road scene, as opposed to those superimposed onto a 2-D map, as is the case with conventional navigation systems. Drivers can then follow the virtual signs in the video to travel to the destination. The challenges of video-based navigation require the use of multiple sensors. The sensor-fusion framework that we propose has two major components: 1) a computer vision module for accurately detecting and tracking the road by using partition sampling and auxiliary variables and 2) a sensor-fusion module using multiple particle filters to integrate vision, Global Positioning Systems (GPSs), and Geographical Information Systems (GISs). GPS and GIS provide prior knowledge about the road for the vision module, and the vision module, in turn, corrects GPS errors.

AB In India, video monitoring of urban roads in order to estimate traffic condition parameters (volume, speed and density) is difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of the traffic and poor lane discipline. As an alternative, a methodology to estimate levels of traffic congestion on urban roads using image processing of monitored video recordings was developed. Four levels of congestion, from completely congested to free-flow conditions, were identified utilising surrogates such as area occupancy or average velocity along with additional attributes such as the number of corner features extracted using image processing. The algorithm was adjusted for changes in lighting and camera angles. The performance of the framework was evaluated on videos recorded from a major road in Chennai, India. The findings indicated that the proposed framework is well-suited for real-time identification of traffic states and has potential as a cost-effective tool for updating traveller information systems in similar road transport networks.

AB Increasing acceptance of electromobility is an important step towards sustainable transportation. However, besides its obvious environmental and economic benefits, the technology of Electric Vehicles (EVs) still has some significant operational drawbacks (e.g. relatively short driving range, long recharging time). Advanced mobile applications supporting travellers' decisions, improving predictability and reliability could play a key role in the promotion of a more widespread use of the technology. Mobile applications can serve as a "platform" between the human component and the integrated system. The aim of our research was to reveal the correspondences between functions, data groups and system components, to create the concept of a complex, integrated information application and to elaborate its innovative functions. As a result of our systematic analysis of the most important, currently available applications, it has been found that important, customizable functions (e.g. charger-point reservation, energy-efficient routing etc.) are not yet available, thus our innovation focused on these information management features. Based on our concept, integrated information applications can be developed, providing real-time personalized service for the users and including all functions related to electromobility.

AB The main purpose of this paper is to present a fuzzy quality function deployment model to achieve service quality assurance before implementing service action. First, customer needs with their importance and satisfaction levels acquired from practical investigations are constructed. Then, by combining the experts' opinions, service management requirements are developed for satisfying the observed customer needs. In addition, a fuzzy relation matrix for linking service management requirements to customer needs is constructed on the basis of cross-functional expertise. The aggregated fuzzy assessments of different service management requirements are also ranked to prioritize and determine their importance. Finally, the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport cargo terminal in Taiwan is used to demonstrate the proposed approach.

AB Two existing techniques are integrated and a methodology for evaluating transportation projects, especially complex projects that involve new technologies, is created. While integrating the multiattribute value function technique with the analytic hierarchy process, a new scaling approach is introduced through use of a linear scaling proxy. Additionally, the approach identifies an overall worth for a project. This overall worth provides decision makers with a quantitative value they can use to compare different projects or to estimate and compare hypothetical results. The methodology is demonstrated in a sample problem. The methodology's application to the Anaheim field operational test is then described. Often, evaluations fall to look at all the potential areas a project may affect. This methodology simplifies the process for including institutional issues in the final results of an evaluation.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK; PREDICTION
AB Highway agencies traditionally have used simple methods to estimate missing values in their data sets since traffic data programs were established in the 1930s. A literature review shows that current practices for imputing traffic data are varied and intuitive. No research has been conducted to assess imputation accuracy. Typical traditional imputation methods used by highway agencies were identified in a study and used to estimate missing hourly volumes for sample traffic counts from Alberta, Canada, to examine their accuracy. It was found that such models usually resulted in large imputation errors. For example, for imputing missing data of a traffic count located on a commuter site, the 95th percentile errors for the traditional methods are usually between 10% and 20%. Advanced models based on genetic algorithms, a time-delay neural network, and locally weighted regression developed in the study show higher accuracy than traditional imputation models. Most of the 95th percentile errors for genetically designed neural network models tested on the same count are below 6%. For genetically designed regression models, the 95th percentile errors are less than 2%. Study results based on the sample traffic counts from different trip pattern groups and functional classes show that underlying traffic patterns have some influence on imputation accuracy. However, genetically designed regression models still can limit the 95th percentile errors to less than 5% in most cases. It is believed that such accurate imputations should be able to supply satisfactory data for decision making at both planning and operation levels.

AB The main purpose of the study was to explore the relationship between cellular phone and safety belt use. Rates of safety belt use of drivers using and drivers not using handheld cellular phones were compared. All data for safety belt and handheld cellular phone use were collected through direct observation while vehicles were stopped at intersections and freeway exit ramps in Michigan. Data were weighted to be representative of drivers during daylight hours in Michigan. Analyses included statistical comparisons of safety belt use rates and a logistic regression model to determine the effects of handheld cellular phone use on safety belt use. The study found that safety belt use for drivers using a handheld cellular phone was significantly lower than for drivers not using cellular phones. This same significant relationship was found within nearly all demographic categories analyzed. The logistic regression model showed that the odds of a handheld cellular phone user not using a safety belt were 1.77 times that of a driver not using a cellular phone. These results stress the importance of the public health issue posed by cellular phone use; not only are those who are conversing on cellular phones potentially more likely to be in a motor vehicle crash, they are also more likely to sustain greater injury because of the lack of safety belt use.

AB Traffic control and travelers' behavior are two mutually influential processes with different objectives. Decisions made in traffic control influence travelers' possibilities in choosing their preferred mode, route, and time of departure; and the choices made by travelers influence the optimization possibilities for traffic control. This research presents the results of simulation studies and a mathematical analysis of this bilevel optimization problem. Under certain conditions, multiple stable situations are possible, but some of these situations are sensitive to small disturbances by which the system moves away from the original equilibrium state. There appears to be a nonlinear relationship between system parameters and the character and location of the equilibrium situations. The details of the travel time model appear to have a large influence. If road authorities want to optimize traffic control, they have to anticipate the reaction of travelers. This makes the optimization process much more complicated. Iterative optimization, where traffic control is adjusted as soon as traffic conditions change, generally does not lead to a system optimum. Methods are therefore necessary that allow for the optimization of traffic control while taking into account that traffic flows will change as a result of traffic control.

AB Excess speeding on roads with a low-speed limit is a key error in drivers of all ages although the reasons for speeding can be significantly different. Drivers aged over 60 are generally more cautious, and take fewer risks than younger aged drivers. This study investigates whether Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) technology can assist older drivers in maintaining vehicle speed. The technology can be employed in three ways: advisory (AISA), differential (DISA) and mandatory (MISA). Twenty-six drivers aged over 60 years old participated along with a comparison group of 16 experienced younger drivers aged under 60. All drivers completed four driving tasks in a driving simulator with and without ISA. Results show improvements in speed and lane-keeping performance vary depending on the type of ISA and driver age and training in effective use of ISA is needed for drivers of all ages. The study is one component of a wider research programme exploring how ITS could potentially help older people overcome some of the difficulties they experience with driving as they age and hopefully help them remain safe drivers for longer, a benefit both to the individual and society.

ID SIMULATION; DESIGN
AB The development of connected and automated driving functions involves that the interaction of autonomous/automated vehicles with the surrounding environment will increase. Accordingly, there is a necessity for an improvement in the usage of traditional tools of the automotive development process. This is a critical problem since the classic development process used in the automotive field uses a very simplified driver model and the traffic environment, while nowadays it should contemplate a realistic representation of these elements. To overcome this issue, the authors proposed an integrated simulation environment, based on the co-simulation of Matlab/Simulink environment with simulation of urban mobility, which allows for a realistic model of vehicle dynamic, control logics, driver behaviour and traffic conditions. Simulation tests have been performed to prove the reasoning for such a tool, and to show the capabilities of the instrument. By using the proposed platform, vehicles may be modelled with a higher level of details (with respect to microscopic simulators), while the autonomous/automated driving functions can be tested in realistic traffic scenarios where the features of the road traffic environment can be varied to verify in a realistic way the level of robustness of the on-board implemented functions.

AB The accuracy of the travel times displayed by the real-time Travel Time Prediction System (TIPS) in a construction work zone was investigated. The TIPS includes changeable message signs (CMSs) displaying the travel time and distance to the end of the work zone to motorists. The travel times displayed by the CMSs are computed by an intelligent traffic algorithm and travel time estimation model of the TIPS software, which takes input from strategically placed microwave radar sensors that detect the vehicle traffic on each lane of the freeway. Besides the CMSs and the radar sensors, the TIPS includes the computer and micro-controller computing the travel times, 220-MHz radios for transmitting data from the sensors to the computer and from the computer to the CMSs, and trailers with solar panels and batteries to power the radar sensors, CMSs, and radios. The evaluation included an accuracy analysis between the predicted and actual recorded travel times. Three crews driving independently of each other in the traffic stream recorded predicted and actual travel times at three CMSs to the end of the work zone for 12 h each day for three consecutive days, resulting in 119 trial runs. On the basis of the regression analysis of actual times versus predicted times, on the average the system does a reasonable job of predicting the travel times to the end of the work zone. About 88% of the actual times recorded for each sign, and for all the signs combined, were within a range of +/- 4 min of the predicted time. However, a few differences (actual versus predicted) as great as 18 min were observed. It is concluded that the real-time TIPS represents a definite improvement over any static non-real-time display system. It provides, in general and most of the time, useful and relatively accurate travel time predictions to the motoring public.

AB At the request of the Joint Program Office for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) of the FHWA, Mitretek Systems conducted a modeling analysis of ITS impacts in support of the metropolitan model deployment initiative evaluation program. The Mitretek modeling study supports the evaluation of the Seattle model deployment Smart Trek, testing a series of hypotheses that could not be addressed in controlled field studies or survey research. Using both a regional planning model and a subarea simulation, the study includes a series of experiments to quantify impacts from integrating ITS technologies and services both across jurisdictions and between functional components. The analysis addressed (a) subarea-wide impacts of traffic signal coordination on major arterials, (b) the impact of integrating arterial data into the current freeway-based advanced traveler information service (ATIS), and (c) interactions at the corridor and the regional levels from concurrent deployment of signal coordination and the enhanced freeway and arterial ATIS. Results from that study have been summarized, detailing findings for a 300-km(2) mixed freeway and arterial subarea network drawn from the roadway system north of downtown Seattle. The coordination of traffic signals along two major arterials resulted in a 7 percent reduction in overall subarea delay and a 3 percent reduction in total stops. More efficient route diversions for ATIS users result from the integration of arterial data into the current web-based service. At currently estimated levels of ATIS usage (6 percent of travelers), this improved diversion efficiency reduces overall subarea delay (users and nonusers) by over 3 percent.

AB Vehicle electrification is a promising approach towards attaining green transportation. However, the absence of charging stations limits the penetration of electric vehicles. Current approaches for optimizing the locations of charging stations suffer from challenges associated with spatial-temporal dynamic travel demands and the lengthy period required for the charging process. The present article uses the electric taxi (ET) as an example to develop a spatial-temporal demand coverage approach for optimizing the placement of ET charging stations in the space-time context. To this end, public taxi demands with spatial and temporal attributes are extracted from massive taxi GPS data. The cyclical interactions between taxi demands, ETs, and charging stations are modeled with a spatial temporal path tool. A location model is developed to maximize the level of ET service on the road network and the level of charging service at the stations under spatial and temporal constraints such as the ET range, the charging time, and the capacity of charging stations. The reduced carbon emission generated by used ETs with located charging stations is also evaluated. An experiment conducted in Shenzhen, China demonstrates that the proposed approach not only exhibits good performance in determining ET charging station locations by considering temporal attributes, but also achieves a high quality trade-off between the levels of ET service and charging service. The proposed approach and obtained results help the decision-making of urban ET charging station siting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Off-roadway crashes involving light vehicles (passenger cars, sport utility vehicles, vans, and pickup trucks) were analyzed based on the 1998 General Estimates System crash database to support the development of countermeasure systems as part of the U.S. Department of Transportation's Intelligent Vehicle Initiative. An off-roadway crash occurs when a vehicle in transport departs the road due to loss of control or crossing the edge of the roadway. Approximately 924,000 such crashes occurred in the United States in 1998. These crashes are grouped into six distinct precrash scenarios (3 x 2 matrix) based on vehicle movements (going straight, negotiating a curve, or initiating a maneuver) and critical events (departed roadway edge or lost control). These scenarios are described statistically in terms of their physical setting, which consists of the roadway type, land use, relation to junction, number of travel lanes, and speed limit. Moreover, factors that might have contributed to the cause of these crashes are identified. According to this analysis, 85 percent of these off-roadway crashes occurred on nonfreeways, 64 percent in rural areas, 83 percent away from junctions, 60 percent on two lanes of travel, and 62 percent below the 89-km/h (55-mph) speed limit. In addition, speeding and alcohol were reported in 25 and 20 percent of these crashes, respectively. Finally, inclement environmental conditions or driver inattention or distraction might have contributed to about 42 percent of these crashes.

AB Increasingly, the proliferation of safety rules is viewed not just as a nuisance but also as a threat to safety itself. Indeed, voluminous and overlapping rules might contribute to poor compliance because of confusion and disagreement about which rules are to be followed. When combined with the existing regime of fault-based injury liability laws governing the industry, rules often become the focus of worker-management conflict rather than tools for communication about safety hazards and solutions. An exploratory assessment of participatory rules revision as an instrument of safety improvement in the U.S. railroad industry is presented. A key premise of the intervention is that rules proliferation is symptomatic of deeper problems with the organizational safety culture that can be addressed through extensive stakeholder participation in the revision process. Data for the study came from three railroads and one in-land barge line. While interview data provided evidence for an impact on the safety culture, initial statistical analysis of the incident data failed to find decreases in incident rates associated with the advent of the formal rules revision process. Further exploration, however, suggested that the intervention actually began earlier with various preparatory activities. Statistical analysis of this revised hypothesis found a significant impact of the intervention on incident rates at one rail carrier, while incident rate declines at two other carriers could not be attributed to the intervention with confidence.

AB Rear-end crashes are the most frequently occurring type of crash, making up approximately 25% of all crashes. Crash analysis has revealed a need to detect stopped and slowing lead vehicles with peripheral vision, as well as to detect stopped and slowing lead vehicles with foveal vision more quickly. Two experiments were conducted in an effort to develop systems that have these properties, yet do not have too much discomfort glare. Both experiments used the same four dependent measures: attention-getting rating, discomfort-glare rating, horizontal peripheral detection angle, and diagonal peripheral detection angle. Experiment 1 examined 17 candidate systems, all using white light and clear lenses. The results showed that the TCL, a lamp with a motorized reflector that moves in an M-sweep pattern, was the top candidate for an imminent crash warning signal, while a pair of centrally located alternating halogen lamps would be optimal for a stopped or slowly moving vehicle signal. Experiment 2 examined the effect of colored lenses for the top four configurations identified from Experiment 1. The results showed that TCL is superior to the alternating pair configurations in attention getting and peripheral detection for an imminent crash warning signal, with glare reduced by the use of tinted lenses in either red or amber. The high-output halogen alternating pair with either amber or red dispersive lenses represents the best available configuration for the stopped or slowly moving vehicle signal.

AB This paper presents a Bayesian approach for modeling and calibrating drivers' en route route changing decision with behavior data collected from laboratory driving simulators and field Bluetooth detectors. The behavior models are not based on assumptions of perfect rationality. Instead, a novel descriptive approach based on naive Bayes' rules is proposed and demonstrated. The en route diversion model is first estimated with behavior data from a driving simulator. Subsequently, the model is recalibrated for Maryland, based on Bluetooth detector data, and applied to analyze two dynamic message sign scenarios on I-95 and I-895. This calibration method allows researchers and practitioners to transfer the en route diversion model to other regions based on local observations. Future research can integrate this en route diversion model with microscopic traffic simulators, dynamic traffic assignment models, and/or activity-based/agent-based travel demand models for various traffic operations and transportation planning applications.

AB In this study, the authors analyse the exponential growth of advanced driver assistance systems based on video processing in the past decade. Specifically, they focus on how research and innovative ideas can finally reach the market as cost-effective solutions. They explore well-known computer vision methods for services like lane departure warning systems, collision avoidance systems and point out potential future trends according to a review of the state-of-the-art. Along this study, the authors' own contributions are described as examples of such systems from the perspective of real-time by design, pursuing a trade-off between the accuracy and reliability of the designed algorithms and the restrictive computational, economical and design requisites of embedded platforms.

ID PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION
AB Drivers' reaction time of reading signs on expressways is a fundamental component of sight distance design requirements, and reaction time is affected by many factors such as information volume and concurrent tasks. We built cognitive simulation models to predict drivers' direction sign reading reaction time. Models were built using the queueing network-adaptive control of thought rational (QN-ACTR) cognitive architecture. Drivers' task-specific knowledge and skills were programmed as production rules. Two assumptions about drivers' strategies were proposed and tested. The models were connected to a driving simulator program to produce prediction of reaction time. Model results were compared to human results in sign reading single-task and reading while driving dual-task conditions. The models were built using existing modelling methods without adjusting any parameter to fit the human data. The models' prediction was similar to the human data and could capture the different reaction time in different task conditions with different numbers of road names on the direction signs. Root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.3 s, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 12%. The results demonstrated the models' predictive power. The models provide a useful tool for the prediction of driver performance and the evaluation of direction sign design.

AB Automated vehicles are entering the roads and automation is applied to cars, trucks, buses, and even motorcycles today. High automation foresees transitions during driving in both directions. The driver and rider state become a critical parameter since reliable automation allows safe intervention and transit control to the automation when manual driving is not performed safely anymore. When the control transits from automation to manual an appropriate driver state needs to be identified before releasing the automated control. The detection of driver states during manual and automated driving and an appropriate design of the human-machine interaction (HMI) are crucial steps to support these transitions. State-of-the-art systems do not take the driver state, personal preferences, and predictions of road conditions into account. The ADAS&ME project, funded by the H2020 Programme of the European Commission, proposes an innovative and fully adaptive HMI framework, able to support driver/rider state monitoring-based transitions in automated driving. The HMI framework is applied in the target vehicles: passenger car, truck, bus, and motorcycle, and in seven different use cases.

AB Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) become an integral part of almost all modern automotive systems. ADAS have been evolving over a decade and the expansion of vision-based ADAS is quite rapid mainly due to the recent advancements in camera technologies. Most of the vision-based ADAS applications have been developed focusing on structured environment parameters and being tested adequately for those environments whereas they cannot be applied with their current framework as such for non-structured environments due to various limitations. This study presents a comprehensive overview of challenges in expanding the vision-based ADAS for non-structured environments. The authors have proposed a segmentation detection method for pedestrians and cyclists in a non-structured road environment to improve the accuracy of the popular deep learning networks. This method uses upper body detection and a pairing technique that improves the average precision significantly without consuming much computational resources. This approach would help to transform the structured environment ADAS to non-structured environments with minimal modifications. With the proposed approach, they are able to increase the accuracy of certain object classes up to 49% for various popular deep learning networks.

AB Most researchers and insurers evaluate driver's risks solely based on user global positioning system (GPS) trajectories. A new approach is proposed that collects individualised driving behaviour data from smartphone GPS module, combined with geographical network information and dynamic traffic conditions, to identify driving risk factors and evaluate driving behaviours in various contexts. The multi-source data reveals real world activity patterns as to when, where and how an individual driver performs, from which performance measurements on both the trip and driver level are defined to measure the risks. In addition, the relationship between the defined driving performance measurements and accident rate can be examined and verified by combining the crash history of the drivers. Numeric analysis on the trip level demonstrates that driving behaviour is context-sensitive, and the principal component analysis performed at the driver level shows that pedal operation and driving speed are the two most important performance measurements to characterise an individual's driving pattern. The subsequent correlation analysis of crash history and driving performances verify both pedal operation and driving speed are significantly related to more at-fault accidents, which validates the modelling and analysis efforts. The findings of their study further existing knowledge and provide foundations for advanced pay-as-you-drive-and-you-save insurance pricing.

AB Drivers always suffer varying degrees of performance decrements under insufficient visual feedback (VF) conditions. Nowadays, haptic guidance (HG) is a developing assistance technology to enhance steering performance; however, driver reactions to HG under degraded VF conditions are still unclear. Therefore, this study focuses on the influence of HG on driving behaviour when part of the road ahead is occluded. The experimental conditions combined three levels of HG, namely none, weak, and strong torques, with four scenarios of VF: whole, near, mid, and far segments. The driving experiment was conducted using a high-fidelity driving simulator with 12 participants. By analysing the standard deviation of lane position and time-to-lane crossing, it was shown that the lane keeping performance became worse without the HG for the degraded VF of near and far segments compared to that of whole and mid-segments. Furthermore, it indicates that the performance decrement in the worse cases was compensated by the implementation of HG, and the strong torque was significantly more effective than the weak torque. Additionally, the use of HG always resulted in an improved turning manoeuvre while approaching curves in the degraded VF of near and far segments.

AB A method is proposed that applies an artificial neural network model to estimate an origin-destination (O-D) matrix for a freeway network for which the data on inflow and outflow at the ramps are gathered regularly. This problem is the same as estimating the elements of an O-D table, given that many sets of data about the right-hand column total (trip production) and the bottom row total (trip attraction) are available. A neural network model is developed to emulate the stimulus-response process on the freeway traffic, in which the stimulus is the inflow at the entrance ramps and the response the outflow at the exit ramps, After the neural network of a particular structure is trained by many sets of data (e.g., sets of daily volumes), the weights of the neural network are found to represent the ramp-to-ramp volume expressed in the proportion of the in-flow at the corresponding ramps. The model is applied to estimate a ramp-to-ramp O-D table for the Tokyo expressway network. The result is compared with the actual O-D table obtained from a survey. The model is round to be useful not only for estimating the O-D volume with much less data than for the traditional method, but also for verifying the existence of a pattern in the traffic flow.

ID TEMPORAL-ORDER; PERCEPTION
AB Railroad crossing collisions are costly in both lives and property damage and are a principal limitation preventing meaningful increases in train speed. At a recent TRB workshop on means of minimizing the frequency of these events, it was agreed that a major hypothesis aimed at explaining the collisions had never been tested. That hypothesis, attributed to Leibowitz, is that the speed of larger objects, like trains, is underestimated by observers owing to a normal deficiency of visual processing. The elements of this hypothesis have begun to be tested in a laboratory setting. While there are numerous aspects to the judgment of speed of approach, studied has been one narrow aspect of the problem that relates to the rapidity with which a gradual increase in the size (starting size 3.7degrees, 5.3degrees, and 7.6degrees side) of a square is perceived by normal human observers. The object is a light gray rectangle set either in a dark gray surround or with no surround. The time required to react to the gradual change averages around 280 milliseconds (ms) after onset. In a significant number of tests on six individuals across conditions ranging from day to night light intensities, expansions in either width or height, and proportional increases in size or fixed increases, the time required to render the judgment increased with the starting size. The rate of increase was approximately 3 ms divided by the degrees of angle sub-tense (360degrees = full circle). Apparently, the initial approach of larger objects is seen more slowly or later than that of smaller ones. If so, this can be shown to translate to a more slowly perceived object speed. Leibowitz may have been correct.

AB This study introduces a general methodology to process sparse floating car data, reconstruct the routes followed by the drivers, and cluster them to achieve suitable choice sets of significantly different routes for calibrating behavioural models. This methodology is applied to a large set of floating car data collected in Rome in 2010. Results underlined that routes assigned to different clusters are actually very different to each other. Nevertheless, as expected according to Wardrop's principle, the clusters belonging to the same origin-destination have rather similar average route travel times, even if there is a large range between their minimum and maximum values. A focus on drivers' behaviour highlighted their propensity to follow the same route to their usual destination, though the 12% of the drivers switched to an alternative route. However, the analysis conducted over the 1 month of observations did not reveal the existence of any systematic correlation between neither the change of route nor the change of departure time and the travel time experienced the day before.

AB In this research, a real-time positioning method, which utilises crowdsourced positioning data obtained from smartphone GPS is developed. Such vehicle location information obtained from crowdsourcing and smartphones in public transport could replace traditional automatic vehicle location systems. However, the location information from smartphone GPS is more erroneous. The proposed methodology serves as an alternative to existing positioning methods to improve the vehicle positioning accuracy. The developed enhanced particle filter algorithm takes smartphone GPS positioning data [from multiple passengers in a single transit vehicle (e.g. bus)] as input data. This crowdsourced' data can then be utilised to calculate the vehicles' positioning information with better accuracy using the developed enhanced particle filter algorithm. The developed algorithm was tested using data collected on 14 different bus routes in urban and suburban areas of Mumbai, India, and it was identified that the algorithm is effective in reducing the average error up to 21.3% from a regular smartphone GPS and 10% from extended Kalman filter algorithm and was able to curtail positioning error within 8.672m (average over 14 routes).

AB Decision makers in freight transportation need to assess new distribution systems and the impacts of changes in the freight distribution environment on infrastructure needs and usage, logistical performance, emissions, and energy use. There is a need, therefore, for behavioral models that can predict goods flows and vehicle flows in both current and future situations. This research outlines a conceptual framework consisting of the markets, actors, and supply chain elements of freight movement. Supply chains are constructed by linking distribution Channels (of different logistics characteristics) between different activity types, such as consumers, supermarkets, stores, offices, distribution centers, and factories. The framework outlined in this research was used to develop the GoodTrip model-a demand-driven, commodity-based freight movement model that incorporates supply chains. Starting with consumer demand, the model estimates goods flows and simulates vehicle tours. The open architecture of the model allows mixed use of empirical data, behavioral models, and scenario-type assumptions. The behavioral models will be developed in future research. In its first application, the GoodTrip model was used to compare the logistical performance and external impacts of three types of urban distribution systems: the traditional system and two concepts using urban distribution centers (one using vans, the other using automated underground vehicles). The results show considerable differences in the performance and effects of the alternatives, especially when they are applied to different types of distribution channels, such as food retail stores or bookstores.

AB Advanced driving assistance systems (ADASs) play a vital role in the safety of transportation. The detection of lane markings is a very important part of ADASs. For the safety of autonomous vehicles and vehicles driven by human drivers, accurate detection results are necessary. In this study, the authors propose a novel algorithm based on lane structural analysis and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for lane marking detection. First, a pre-processing stage is used to remove the pavement that constitutes the background of the lane markings. Next, a set of local waveforms from local images is used to generate a region of interest and a CNN classifier is employed to detect lane marking candidates. Finally, a lane geometry analysis stage determines whether or not the candidate is a part of a lane marking. The major contributions of this study can be summarised as follows. First, they propose a novel method to describe a road using waveforms. Second, they analyse the local and global characteristics of the road geometry to detect the lane markings. Third, they provide an effective method to obtain training data for the proposed machine learning method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods.

Different approaches, such as k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and support vector machines (SVMs), were used in this study. Further, this study also developed a hybrid model combining a data-driven approach (SVM) and a model-based approach [particle filter (PF)] for corridor-level travel-time estimation. Both static and dynamic parameters, such as road geometry, intersection length, location information from Global Positioning System devices, dwell time etc. were used as influential factors for modelling. The proposed algorithm was tested on a study corridor of length 59.48 km, in the arterials of Mumbai, India. The data was collected using a probe-vehicle technique for five days during the morning peak period (from 8.00 am to 11.00 am) for two modes (car and bus). The mean absolute percentage error values obtained for the hybrid model for the two modes were: 9.96 (car) and 11.24 (bus). The performance of the proposed hybrid (SVM-PF) algorithm showed a clear improvement in accuracy in comparison to existing standard methods such as k-NN, GBDT and SVM.

AB RSSB and the University of Southampton's GeoData Institute have collaborated to research and develop a toolkit for managing large volumes of rail risk data. The pilot system encompasses concepts of highly complex geospatial big data', open standards, open source development tools and methodologies, and enables stakeholders to filter, analyse and visualise risk across the rail network, for a range of risk models. These include train derailments, suicides and passenger slip, trips and falls, and feature a wide range of spatially dependent parameters that affect the causal, escalation and consequence mechanisms. The risk has been calculated to a high resolution, splitting 2,100,000 m of track typically into 10 m sections. By creating geospatial representations of risk, the tool can help to identify risk hotspots and in this way contribute to the improvement of rail safety. Once scaled up to a National level and full range of risk models, the tool will deliver a powerful capability, unique across Europe. Further research is extending the prototype to incorporate live and historic environmental and related rail incident data to augment and improve the risk model.

AB Transfers between urban rail transit (URT) and its feeder modes represent a considerable barrier to its ridership and the network-wide usage of public transit. The aim of this research is to quantify the time-independent transfer penalty between URT system and feeder modes and to explore its variability by different factors. Based on Melbourne URT origin and destination survey data, this study focused on URT access and egress journeys and estimated URT feeder transfer penalties by formulating feeder mode choice models. With three-hourly weather data and demographical data introduced, this paper conducted disaggregate analyses to investigate the variability of URT feeder transfer penalty across weather conditions, trip types and individual characteristics. According to the model estimation results, the values of transfer penalty vary according to the direction of transfer and the preference ordering for different transfer combinations is URT-tram, URT-bus, tram-URT, bus-URT and auto-URT. It found that local weather elements in terms of air temperature and precipitation are significant factors resulting in the variability of the transfer perception by URT travellers. Transfer penalties for access journeys increase with the rise of air temperature. The non-linear effects of precipitation on URT feeder transfer penalties were observed. In addition, commuters perceive smaller transfer penalties than other travellers for all of the transfer combinations except for bus-URT transfers. Travelers from remote areas perceive smaller transfer penalties for access trips. Travellers' loyalty to public transit restrains transfer penalties. The male travellers perceive higher transfer penalties than the female. The elderly travellers impose low transfer penalties to access journeys but high transfer penalties for egress journeys. Finally, the paper explored policy implications and details areas for future research.

AB Short-term traffic flow forecasting has been regarded as essential for intelligent transportation systems, including both point prediction and interval prediction. Compared with point prediction, interval prediction of traffic flow in the future will be critical for traffic managers to make reasonable decisions. This study applies the fuzzy information granulation method to obtain the dispersion range of the collected traffic flow time series, and classical forecasting approaches of K-nearest neighbours, back-propagation neural network, and support vector regression are applied on the dispersion range and the original series itself, constituting a short-term traffic flow forecasting system with the capability of joint point and interval prediction. Using real-world traffic flow data collected from a field transportation system in America, the proposed forecasting system is shown to generate workable point prediction and associated prediction interval, demonstrating the validity of the proposed forecasting system. In addition, for unravelling the impact of time interval on the forecasting system, different time intervals are investigated, showing that with the increase in time interval, the stability of the forecasting system increases. Discussions are provided for the proposed approach, and future works are expected to enhance the proposed forecasting system.

ID ATTENTION
AB To assess driver distraction because of video advertising signs, eye fixation data were collected from subjects who passed four video advertising signs, three at downtown intersections and one on an urban expressway. On average, drivers glanced at the signs on 45% of the occasions on which the signs were present. When drivers looked, they made 1.9 glances, on average, with an average duration per glance of 0.48 s. The distribution of eye fixations on intersection approaches where video signs were visible was compared with that on approaches on which video signs were not visible. No significant differences were found in the number of glances made at traffic signals or street signs. On the video approach, a greater proportion of glances were made at the speedometer. and rearview mirrors. Glances were made at short headways and occasionally in unsafe circumstances. In the downtown area, glances at static commercial signs were made at larger angles and at shorter headways than was the case for video signs. A comparison of the results with those of other studies showed that video signs were less likely to be looked at than traffic signs (about half the time versus virtually every time, respectively) and that individual average glance durations and total durations were similar to those found for traffic signs in rural environments. These results apply to particular video signs in particular environments. Another on-road study indicates that a video sign on a curve that is close to the line of sight and visible for an extensive period is particularly distracting.

AB Owing to the limited-time relevance and labour cost of traditional traffic service surveys, the quantity and quality of the data collected are not satisfactory in many cases. As more people are becoming active on comment websites and given the advances in natural language processing (NLP) techniques, it is feasible to conduct the opinion mining of comments regarding transportation services at large scale and low cost. In this study, >25,900 comments on websites regarding various public transportation services in Shanghai were analysed using NLP techniques, including sentiment analysis to calculate people's satisfaction with different transit facilities, keyword extraction to understand the key point in comments, and co-occurrence analysis to understand the commonality and characteristics of different routes. The sentiment analysis shows that people are more satisfied with traffic hubs than vehicles, and people have the highest level of satisfaction with airports and the lowest level of satisfaction with buses. The keywords classified by sentiment values show the strengths and weaknesses of Bus No. 49. Finally, the authors interpret a few anomalies of the results by tracing the context around the keywords. This study designs an NLP approach of transportation survey to improve the quality of public transportation service.

AB This study investigated the effectiveness of ground-mounted diagrammatic signs in the context of urban multilane arterials leading to freeways. Six highway-freeway interchanges were selected in the greater Columbus, Ohio, area for installation of the diagrammatic signs in the field. The primary measure of effectiveness was the distance at which unfamiliar drivers driving in the wrong lane changed lanes. A total of 21 and 19 test drivers unfamiliar with Columbus roads were recruited for an evaluation before and after installation of the diagrammatic guide signs. This evaluation with unfamiliar test drivers showed that drivers were able to execute a needed lane change earlier when diagrammatic signs were provided. Combining all six sites and looking at the 50th (377 m before, 819 m after) and 85th percentile (203 m before, 601 m after) lane change distances, an increase by a factor of 2.2 to 3.0 between the after and before condition was observed. In addition, a panel of 13 Ohio Department of Transportation and FHWA evaluators visited the six interchange sites and provided their input and opinions on the use of diagrammatic signs. The majority of the evaluators fully embraced the idea of diagrammatic signs. It is suggested that such signs should be used on multilane arterials in advance of highway-freeway interchanges in addition to preexisting guide signs (trailblazer assemblies), in cases in which the cost of overhead span-type sign bridges cannot be economically justified and additional advance guidance information to motorists is highly desirable.

AB A comprehensive set of Global Positioning System (GPS) vehicle location data from Lexington, Kentucky, households was analyzed to determine if such data can be helpful in improving path choice assumptions in traffic assignment models. The portion of the data used consisted primarily of a reconstruction of the street network and the lists of street segments in each path. Analysis was based on matches of trips (e.g., pairs of trips with similar origins and destinations). Matches were obtained for trips within households and for trips across households. Statistics used to compare trips in matches were a path deviation index and the percentage of identical links. It was found that the path chosen on a trip was quite sensitive to the location of the origin and destination and that the chosen path most often differed considerably from the shortest time path across the network. Paths for trips made by the same driver were very consistent over time; paths by different drivers showed more deviations even when the trip ends were the same or very similar. As a result of this research, recommendations are made as to how GPS data on path choice can be better collected in the future for improvement of traffic assignment models.

ID PREFERENCE
AB Driver behavior under congestion pricing is analyzed to evaluate the effects of alternative congestion pricing schemes. The analysis, which is based on stated preference survey results, focuses on time allocation, departure time choice, and route choice when a congestion pricing scheme is implemented on toll roads in Japan. A unique feature of the model system of this study is that departure time choice and route choice are analyzed in conjunction with the activities before and after the trip. A time allocation model is developed to describe departure time choice, and a route and departure time choice model is developed as a multinomial logit model with alternatives representing the choice between freeways and surface streets and, for departure time, the choice from among before, during, or after the period when congestion pricing is in effect. The results of the empirical analysis suggest that departing during the congestion pricing period tends to have higher utilities and that a worker and a nonworker have quite different utility functions. The comparative analysis of different congestion pricing schemes is carried out based on the estimated parameters. The results suggest that the probability of choosing each alternative is stable even if the length of the congestion pricing period changes, but a higher congestion price causes more drivers to change the departure time to before the congestion pricing period.

AB Inappropriate speed in negotiating curves is the primary cause of rollovers and sideslips. In this study, the authors proposed an improved curve speed model considering driving styles, as well as vehicle and road factors. On the basis of a vehicle-road interaction model, the driver behaviour factor was introduced to quantify driving styles of curve speed choices. Firstly, the fuzzy synthetic evaluation method was utilised to classify the driving styles of 30 professional drivers into three different types (i.e. cautious, moderate and aggressive). Secondly, the classification results using fuzzy synthetic evaluation were compared to and verified with the K-means clustering method resulting over 60% the similarities. Finally, the proposed curve speed model was built and compared with four existing models. The authors' model has the following promising advantages: (i) it reflects the speed preferences of three different types of drivers on the premise of driving safety on curves; and (ii) it shows a stationary speed transition when the road adhesion coefficient exceeds 0.8, which indicates that rollover, instead of sideslip, becomes the primary cause for lateral instability crashes on curves. Therefore, this proposed curve speed model could be applied in a curve speed warning system to improve both driving safety and comfort.

AB It is increasingly being recognized at all levels of decision making that freight transportation and economic development are inextricably linked. As a result, many urban entities and states are embarking upon comprehensive freight transportation planning efforts aimed at ensuring safe, efficient, and smooth movement of freight along multimodal and intermodal networks. Over the past few decades there has been considerable published research on (1) freight transportation factors, (2) freight travel demand modeling methods, (3) freight transportation planning issues, and (4) freight data needs, deficiencies, and collection methods. A synthesis of the body of knowledge in these four areas is provided with a view to developing a comprehensive statewide freight transportation planning framework. The proposed framework consists of two interrelated components that facilitate demand estimation and decision making in the freight transportation sector.

AB The Washington State Department of Transportation website allows those with access to a computer and the Internet to obtain current information about traffic conditions on freeways and bridges in the metropolitan Seattle area. Potential benefits of disseminating real-time traveler information are time and cost savings to users as a result of informed travel choices (route, time, mode, destination, add or forgo a trip), increased user confidence in travel choices, and reduction in congestion, pollution, and other external costs. These benefits depend on how many users access the information, what choices they make, how much time they save or in what other ways they find the information valuable, and how their choices affect the transportation system. Although a good deal of this information is available for Seattle or can be estimated from comparable contexts, the data are inadequate to determine within a broad range whether net benefits are positive or negative. A spreadsheet model is presented that allows relevant data to be applied-and "what if" numbers to be inserted where necessary-as a basis for identifying the performance characteristics and levels needed to make a traveler information service a worthwhile investment.

AB Real time driver health condition monitoring system with drowsiness alertness was proposed. A new embedded electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor with electrically conductive fabric electrodes on the steering wheel of a car was designed to monitor the driver's health condition. The ECG signals were measured at a sampling rate of 100 Hz from the driver's palms as they stay on a pair of conductive fabric electrodes located on the steering wheel. Practical tests were conducted using an embedded ECG sensor with a wireless sensor node, and their performance was assessed under non-stop 2 h driving test. The ECG signals were measured and transmitted wirelessly to a base station connected to a server PC in personal area network environment. The driver's health condition such as the normal, fatigued and drowsy states was analysed by evaluating the heart rate variability in the time and frequency domains.

AB yImprovements to public transportation services are being made, or can be made, to offer better public transportation services for older travelers. Communities in which some of the most forward-looking ideas have been applied were examined. A number of short-term, low-cost improvements have been shown to be beneficial, but new perspectives are also needed. In the long run, multiple types of services, offered at varying prices, are needed to replace the "one size fits all" approach to public transportation with options that riders could choose on their own to fit the specific demands of individual days and trips. Shared-ride, demand-responsive services, dispatched and controlled through advanced technologies, could provide higher levels of service than now available and at higher levels of productivity and cost-effectiveness. Frequent, comfortable, affordable, spontaneous service to a wide variety of origins and destinations over a wide range of service hours is what seniors desire. A serious challenge for the public transportation industry will be finding ways of providing such services while collecting revenues that cover their costs. A key finding of this research is that the transportation service attributes most highly valued by older riders are not markedly different from those valued by other transit riders, so that improvements that would best serve older riders will also attract significant numbers of other riders.

AB An integral component of (in-vehicle) navigation systems is the determination of optimal routes to the desired destination. An implicit assumption in the underlying algorithms is that people do not make mistakes when following the prescribed routes. This is, however, not always consistent with reality, especially when driving in unfamiliar environments. This article presents a first look at the possibility of mistakes when driving. This possibility is formalized in a Markov decision process. It is demonstrated that quite paradoxical situations can occur when accounting for mistakes. As the most interesting-but perhaps extreme-example, we have shown that under certain conditions, it is no longer optimal to recommend drivers to take the shortest route. Instead, a longer route (in certain cases even the longest!) becomes optimal. Numerical results are provided throughout the article to reveal the fundamental properties of this problem.

ID PERFORMANCE; ACCIDENTS; FATIGUE
AB Many transportation industries operate under conditions that require workers on a 24-h basis. Unfortunately, these working conditions often negatively affect the workers' ability to obtain sufficient sleep and to maintain the necessary alertness while on the job. The work schedules of locomotive engineers provide one example of 24-h-based work. Most engineers, however, not only have to work at different times of the day and night, but also must work under an on-call system, which typically results in highly irregular work hours. The relationship between irregular work schedules as experienced by locomotive engineers and subjective alertness was examined by producing a predictive model of on-duty alertness using work- and sleep-related variables as predictors. One hundred twenty-four locomotive engineers completed a 14-day activity log on work time, time off work, sleep habits, and on-duty alertness. The results from the regression analyses indicated that the single best predictor of on-duty alertness was the time of day that alertness was recorded. This result indicated that the human endogenous rhythm to be alert during the day and sleepy at night was the major predictor of on-duty alertness even in the irregular schedules experienced by most locomotive engineers. Other work- and sleep-related variables such as time that the employee was notified when to report to work, work duration, and sleep duration were also significant predictors of on-duty alertness. Operationally, the current results suggest that nighttime workers will experience less alertness than daytime workers. Thus, specific countermeasures addressing alertness and fatigue during nighttime work should be developed, such as better predictability of work scheduling and on-duty napping.

AB Determining the position of the vehicles on road is an important information in the driver assistance system which is used to increase driver's safety. The authors propose a robust real-time vehicle detection and distance estimation method for vision-based driving assistance system. They detect the vehicles in front of their own and estimate their three-dimensional position by using a single monochrome camera. After detecting the preceding vehicles using the common method, they use a new method for distance measurement based on monocular camera to estimate the inter-vehicle distance. The method also provides the longitudinal distance information for the driver alarm system. Finally, they utilise the Kalman framework to update the information of the vehicle which they detected before, the information includes horizontal distance, vertical distance and speed, and use these information to predict risk. Experimental results indicate that the system correctly detects vehicles in real time and effectively estimates the position of preceding vehicles.

ID TRUCKS
AB The North American vehicle fleet has evolved in recent years to include an increasing percentage of pickups, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and minivans. In 2002, sales of light trucks and vans accounted for almost half of all Canadian vehicle sales. The increased popularity of SUVs, has been particularly striking, with a 143% increase in sales since 1993. Typically larger and heavier than automobiles, SUVs are built on frames that are more rigid and that ride higher, characteristics that not only provide increased physical protection to their occupants but also add to their overall appeal. SUVs, however, are involved in fatal rollover crashes at a much higher rate than cars. While this is undoubtedly due in part to their stiffer frames and higher centers of gravity, the manner in which SUVs are driven, may also play a role. SUV drivers are often anecdotally reported to be overconfident, tending to overestimate their vehicle's capabilities. Evidence suggests that because they sit higher, drivers of SUVs (and vans and pickups) are less able to judge speed accurately. A study was conducted to assess drivers' chosen speed when they operated a simulated vehicle while viewing the road from a low eye height and a high eye height. Participants were instructed to drive, without reference to a speedometer, at a highway driving speed at which they felt comfortable and safe. As expected, drivers seated at a high eye height drove faster than when they were seated at a low eye height. The influence of driver eye height and lead vehicle size (large versus small) on the following distance from a slower-moving lead vehicle was also investigated. Regardless of eye height, the differences in following distances suggest that the size of the lead vehicle may affect how closely drivers choose to follow it.

AB Household replenishment and consumer direct-two closely related and developing forms of teleshopping that are emerging as strategies within the broader realm of supply chain management-could have an impact on behavior related to grocery shopping trips, as well as on commercial development. In concept, household replenishment and consumer direct are the businesses of delivering groceries to households through various means. These grocery delivery systems have the potential to change household activity behavior, which could result in numerous changes throughout the transportation network. An examination of the relevant issues surrounding implementation of household replenishment and consumer direct, and an analysis of their potential impact on transportation systems planning, are provided. A conceptual framework for modeling changes in business and household behavior is also offered.

AB In recent years, advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) have been used to improve the safety of vehicles by either providing additional information to the driver or by taking over complete control. The majority of ADASs currently being utilised run entirely on the vehicle, only having access to information provided by the sensors that are onboard the vehicle itself. Part of the next step in the evolution of ADAS is to incorporate information from other offsite sensors or obtain control inputs from infrastructure which can coordinate multiple vehicles simultaneously via a wireless interface. Wireless communication is inherently delayed and prone to dropped packets. This study looks at the effect of transport latencies and dropped packets on an off-site autoregressive steering controller supplying direct steering inputs to a vehicle. A fully non-linear vehicle simulation model is used to test the effect of delaying steering inputs and dropped packets to test the stability of the controller. The study shows that at dropped packet percentages of up to 40% adequate vehicle control is maintained, while transport latencies of up to 100 ms allow for moderately accurate vehicle control.

AB The purpose of this study was to understand the adverse consequences of driving reduction or cessation among elderly adults. A comprehensive literature search was conducted for studies that (a) included information on driving by an elderly population, (b) included results from a qualitative or quantitative (or both) study of the elderly and driving cessation, and (c) provided information to evaluate consequences surrounding driving reduction or cessation. The selected subjects of the studies included men and women over the age of 55 years. Driving reduction or cessation is associated with a number of adverse consequences, including reduced activity out of the home and decreased life satisfaction. However, determining causality of the associations is difficult because of unidentified third variables (such as health). Understanding the adverse consequences will aid researchers and policy makers to develop better strategies to help people anticipate and prepare for reduced driving and to develop and improve transportation alternatives.

AB Results of human factors laboratory studies conducted in Texas pertaining to the display of messages using the following dynamic characteristics of changeable message signs (CMSs) are presented: (a) the effect of flashing an entire one-frame message, (b) the effect of flashing one line of a one-frame message; and (c) the effect of alternating text on one line of a three-line CMS while keeping the other two lines of text the same. Two hundred sixty Texas drivers were recruited in Dallas, El Paso, Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio to participate in the laboratory studies designed to simulate these CMS characteristics on laptop computers. The drivers responded to questions designed to determine the level of recall and comprehension of the information contained in the message. Response times, message format, and sign operating preferences were also collected. The results showed that in the laboratory setting, flashing a one-frame message did not adversely affect driver recall or comprehension to a significant degree compared with when the message was not flashed. However, average reading times were significantly higher when the message was flashed. Flashing one line of a three-line message appeared to adversely affect recall of parts of the message. In addition, average reading times were significantly higher for the flashing line message. Alternating one line of text and keeping the other two lines constant did not adversely affect message recall. However, average reading times increased significantly.

AB The issue of distracted driving by the smartphone is of primary importance for road safety. This study discusses the results of a simulated driving experiment that explores the effects of four smartphone usages on driving performance across a range of driver ages and experiences also considering the gender factor. Unlike most similar studies, which mainly focus on a single element at a time (gender influence, specific age group, etc.), the proposed experimental design investigates the extent to which several combinations of factors related to the driver, the driving environment and the specific smartphone usage may affect driving performance. Using ANOVA and ANCOVA it has emerged that: (i) Age seems to significantly affect driving behaviour, older drivers tend to reduce their speed when using smartphones. (ii) Consistently with previous research, the risk of collision increases for all age groups when using smartphones. (iii) Drivers tend to increase their speed during a phone conversation. This interesting result may indicate how much the perception of risk associated with smartphone use has changed alarmingly in short time. Outcomes provide new knowledge based on experimental evidence and can support legislators towards introducing effective measures to counteract the widespread use of the phone when driving.

AB An instrumented vehicle study was performed on a motorway in the United Kingdom to examine the behavior of drivers faced with the cutin of a vehicle lane-changing into the space between themselves and the preceding vehicle. Data concerning this activity are in short supply and may be used not only in formulating models of human response in driving but also in designing and optimizing driver assistance aids such as adaptive cruise control (ACC). The cut-in vehicle used was equipped with a rear-facing radar unit enabling it to monitor the degree and speed with which drivers attempted to restore their original headway. Cut-ins from both directions were examined-moving in from a slower lane (94 events) and from a faster lane (72 events). The criticality experienced by the follower vehicle ranged from moderately severe [time to collision (TTC) around 10 s and time gap around 0.35 s] to noncritical (lead car's speed-at cut-in greater than follower speed and time headway beyond steady-state values). Findings indicate that the "pullback" behavior, at least over the initial 5 to 10 s, can be described by a constant pullback speed (the rate of decrease of the initial speed), and causative models for this response have been derived using "instantaneous" variables (those that may be calculated on cut-in, such as relative speed and TTC) and longer-term "target" variables, such as desired headway, the former of which have been most effective in describing behavior. Finally, empirical responses have been compared with those that would be produced by ACC systems; it, was found that a comparatively close match is produced for low values of relative speed.

AB The braking responses of drivers in the Iowa Driving Simulator (IDS) were compared with those of drivers on a test track. The braking profile of drivers was compared in last-minute braking situations in which drivers were instructed to brake "normally" or "hard." Although the motion and visual cues in the IDS are imperfect, the data agree in many respects. The general pattern of results is similar, with the initial speed and lead vehicle deceleration affecting drivers on the test track and in the simulator in a similar way. In several experimental conditions, the similarity of the responses went beyond the general pattern of response. The mean values were almost identical in several instances, and the values were frequently well within the confidence intervals. Although the simulator and test track drivers performed similarly, differences are apparent from the onset of braking, through the braking process, and in the outcome of the braking event. The instructions concerning normal and hard braking had little influence on the behavior of drivers in the simulator. Contributors to these differences include the limited visual and vestibular cues in the simulator and the extended practice on the test track.

AB This study uses behavioural data from the complete drive for a subset of 54 participants from the automation expectation mismatch set of test track experiments and aims to develop an algorithm that can predict which drivers are likely to crash. Participants experienced 30 min of highly reliable supervised automation and were required to intervene to avoid crashing with a stationary object at the end of the drive. Many of them still crashed, despite having their eyes on the conflict object. They were informed about their role as supervisors, automation limitations, and received attention reminders if visually distracted. Three pre-conflict behavioural patterns were found to be associated with increased risk of crash involvement: low levels of visual attention to the forward path, high per cent road centre (i.e. gaze concentration), and long visual response times to attention reminders. One algorithm showed very high performance in classifying crashers when combining metrics related to all three behaviours. This algorithm is possible to implement as a real-time function in eye-tracker equipped vehicles. The algorithm can detect drivers that are not sufficiently engaged in the driving task, and provide feedback (e.g. reduce function performance, turn off function) to increase their engagement.

AB Intelligent transportation systems present a well-known innovation opportunity to address urban congestion and allow greater access to transportation networks. New sources of travel information are emerging rapidly, and they are likely to significantly affect traveler decisions and transportation network performance. To assess the value and impact of these new sources, a comprehensive conceptual model is developed on the basis of information processing and traveler response. Specifically, the model accounts for the effect of information source, content, and quality on information access and travel behavior. Empirical evidence from several behavioral surveys conducted in the San Francisco Bay Area between 1995 and 1999 is presented. The surveys used innovative methods to study the response of the whole population, the response of people more inclined to use information technology (early adopters), and traveler decision making in high-benefit incident situations. The conceptual model helps to integrate and interpret empirical findings from the surveys. The issues of access to new and conventional technologies and services, their current market penetration levels, switching behavior concerning new information sources and information service providers, desired information content, and willingness to pay for dynamic information are discussed. The opportunities and limitations of new technologies and the implications for future technology implementations are described.

AB The vicinity of traffic signals is one of the most special and critical areas in the whole road system. Considering that the driver can obtain traffic signals information through two approaches: vision and the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2X) communication equipment in the vehicle, this study proposes two vehicle cooperative driving models that apply to the vicinity of traffic signals: the intelligent driver model (IDM) in the vicinity of traffic signals (IDM-VT) and IDM in the vicinity of traffic signals under V2X environment (IDM-VT-V2X). These two models are both based on the intelligent driver model. In accordance with different situations of vehicles in the vicinity of traffic signals, such as distance from the traffic lights, whether there was another vehicle in front and different states of traffic lights, the pertinent analysis was conducted, and the cooperative driving strategy that satisfied the complicated situations of vehicle was proposed. These two models were verified and compared in the simulation experiment. The results of simulation show that when comparing with the IDM-VT, the IDM-VT-V2X can reduce the average travel time and the average stop delay time by 12.98 and 98.32%, respectively, and it can also reduce 22.53% fuel consumption.

AB Pavement Management System (PMS) is used to conduct efficient pavement management. Since the pavement network is generally large and complex in scale, the reliability of the pavement network cannot be easily determined by applying conventional serial or parallel reliability models, or even a combination of the two. The objective of this paper is to propose a novel model by employing fuzzy set theory and dual-network method to calculate the relative importance of each pavement route and estimate the reliability of a pavement network. A fuzzy condition model is developed to describe the condition state of pavement management segments, pavement links, pavement routes, and eventually the whole network. The spatial weight of each pavement route is represented by the node degree of the corresponding dual-network. A case study is conducted by using the pavement network of Travis County, Texas, to illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. The results show that the model is able to calculate the relative importance of each route and determine the reliability of the given pavement network. This paper could help transportation agencies obtain more insight information on relative importance of each roadway and make more effective decisions on pavement network maintenance with a limited budget.

AB Travel time is one of the most fundamental and important determinants of travel behavior. However, the travel time on which a travel decision is based is a subjective one (i.e., it is an anticipated travel time). A conceptual model of the formation of an anticipated travel time through information acquisition and initial driving experience is proposed. Dayto-day data of anticipated travel times were collected during a Closure of the Hanshin Expressway Sakai Route, a toll road connecting the central business districts of Osaka and Sakai, which is located approximately 20 km south of the Osaka route closure. A test was conducted of the information dominance hypothesis (i.e., as drivers acquire more information on travel time, they can predict travel time more precisely and refer less to anticipated travel times used in the past to anticipate travel times) and the experience dominance hypothesis (i.e., influences of information not from driving experience on anticipated travel time is weaker with actual driving experience than without actual experience). Although word of mouth information does not have impacts consistent with these two hypotheses, results with other types of information support both hypotheses.

AB Large-scale activities, holidays, and emergencies often cause a significantly large burst of passenger flow demand in some urban rail transit (URT) stations in a short time, called large passenger flow (LPF). The LPF will propagate through the entire URT network of the city. The impact of the frequent occurrence of LPF on network service levels is crucial and unpredictable. This article describes an analysis of how this LPF propagates through the entire network inspired by how radionuclide imaging is done in clinical medicine. In this study, with LPF of URT as the research object, a propagation model of LPF in URT based on AFC data, train operation data, and URT network topology data was developed, which was inspired by the concept of radionuclide imaging in clinical medicine. In the condition of obtaining the list of passenger route selection ratios, the dynamic propagation state matrix of the LPF in the network is solved. The contribution value matrix of the LPF was proposed to evaluate the impact of the LPF on the URT network. Considering the LPF in Chengdu East Railway Station, China, as an example, the propagation effect of LPF in the Chengdu Metro network was analyzed, and the effectiveness of the proposed model was confirmed.

ID DIVIDED ATTENTION; DRIVING SIMULATOR; WARNING SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE; AGE
AB Experienced older drivers and relatively inexperienced younger drivers drove a simulator equipped with a headway detection and alerting device (HDAD): The device alerted the driver when the time headway (TH) to the lead car was too short. The device occasionally emitted false alarms on the basis of a predefined reliability level. The HDAD was not activated for the control group. The experimental groups that drove with the HDAD maintained a TH within an "optimal" zone (2 s <= TH <= 4 s) during significantly more of the driving time than the control group. Drivers who used the HDAD discriminated between true alerts and false alarms and responded more often to true alerts. All groups maintained, on average, a safe headway (> 2 s). Although the average time in the danger zone was different for the younger and the older drivers, the variance within both groups, especially within the older driver group, was large and neutralized the difference. When the reliability of HDAD was the highest (99%), the driver's headway was shorter, although it was still well within the safe range. This could indicate increased confidence inspired by a very reliable device. Although multiple auditory stimuli were clearly defined during the experiment, they still caused confusion, especially for the older drivers, and may have hindered better performance. The results associate conflicting auditory signals as possible deterrents to the effective use of in-car aids for older drivers who may have trouble dividing attention among the inputs. Suggestions are given as to how in-car driver-aid interfaces can be improved for older drivers.

AB Intelligent transport systems provide various means to improve capacity and travel time in road networks. Evaluation of the benefits of these improvements requires consideration of travellers' response to them. We consider a continuous-time equilibrium model of departure time choice and identify a formula for the dynamic equilibrium departure rate profile. We develop the analysis to consider the effect on the cost incurred by travellers of ITS measures through their effects on each of the travel time in the absence of congestion, and the capacity for travel. This shows the importance in choice of departure time of travellers' values of time at each of the origin and destination of their journeys. We show the importance of these values of time in evaluation, and that if travellers value their time at both the origin and destination of their, journeys, their responses will lead them to achieve a greater reduction in costs than would be achieved under free-flow conditions.

ID AUTOMATION
AB Behavioral adaptation describes the collection of behaviors that occur after a change in the road traffic system. Typically, those behaviors not intended by the initiators of the change having a negative impact on safety are of particular interest. Although behavioral adaptation is frequently cited as an explanatory variable for observed discrepancies between engineering estimates and actual outcomes of safety interventions, a thorough understanding of behavioral adaptation does not, at present, exist. Most theories posit that a driver's goal to maintain an acceptable level of risk will determine if and when behavioral adaptation will occur; few models incorporate individual driver characteristics into their explanation of behavioral adaptation. Recently, a qualitative model of behavioral adaptation was proposed. The model predicts that the degree of behavioral adaptation to a novel road safety intervention depends on several psychological characteristics of the individual, including propensity to trust automation, "locus of control," and inclination toward sensation-seeking. To test the predictions of this model, simulator and test-track studies were conducted to investigate the ability of lane departure warnings to induce behavioral adaptation in drivers performing a secondary number-entry task. While the presence of reliable warnings in both settings improved lane-keeping performance, drivers tended to report a high degree of trust in both accurate and inaccurate systems, despite the intentional infidelity of the latter. Externals and low sensation-seekers were more likely to report an increase in trust in the system, regardless of its accuracy. The collective results from both studies indicate that, because of the propensity of some people to trust unreliable or faulty devices, caution should be used in attempting to predict the aggregate safety benefits of these systems.

AB The effects of two types of vision enhancement system (VES) displays on younger- and older-driver performance were systematically examined in various contexts. Younger and older drivers used either a conformal or a nonconformal VES display while driving in a fixed-base driving simulator. Within each block of trials, traffic scenarios were used to test driver performance: everyday driving, intersection approaches, emergency events, and VES failure. Conformal imagery directly highlighted aspects of the traffic environment, whereas nonconformal displays were coupled to environmental events but not superimposed on them. In all driving scenarios, conformal displays had a performance advantage over nonconformal displays. These advantages, however, depended on what was highlighted and whether a highlight covered or obscured important information about the environment. The perceived benefits of VESs are in situations where visibility is limited by weather (e.g., fog, snow, or rain), time of day (e.g., night or dusk), or roadway geometry (e.g., curves or railway crossings). Implications of the results for the design of conformal and nonconformal VESs and for future research are discussed.

AB Value of time for trucks was estimated from stated preference data collected in California. Truckers were asked about a choice between an existing free road versus a toll facility for different combinations of travel time and cost. Estimation was based on the point of diversion at which the switch of facility occurred in the stated preference questions and also on the use of a modified logit model in which the coefficients to be estimated were assumed to be distributed lognormally across the population. Comparisons between data sets that were segmented according to business type, shipment size, and the method of driver compensation indicated that for-hire trucks tend to have higher values of time than private ones and the companies that pay drivers hourly wages have higher values of time than those who pay commissions or fixed salary.

AB In this study drivers are assumed to reason and learn inductively based on the theory of cognitive psychology. The model system is basically a production system, a compilation of if-then rules in which the rules are revised by applying genetic algorithms. The behavior of drivers and network flow through Monte Carlo simulation using the model system is examined. The intention of this research is to shed light on the behavior of a driver-network system from a new standpoint, one different from that of equilibrium analysis. This research views drivers' behaviors as psychological and heterogeneous rather than economical and homogeneous. The results of the numerical experiments can be summarized as follows: (1) network flow does not necessarily converge to the user equilibrium; (2) drivers form a delusion, an extremely biased perception of travel time as a result of experiencing excessive travel times on early parts of the simulation in which little experience had been gained; (3) the delusion is dissolved by switching routes capriciously; and (4) without caprice drivers continue to travel on the same route because of their delusions and develop the habit of choosing the same route, thus freezing their behaviors. These results indicate that system behavior is much more complex and dynamic than implied by equilibrium analysis.

AB Understanding the intentions of other road users increases subjective certainty, improves one's own performance and contributes to enhanced traffic safety. The perception and processing of situational characteristics are pivotal to develop an appropriate situation model as the basis of anticipation in dynamic traffic situations. To gather further insights into the process of situation comprehension, different situational characteristics were tested in a laboratory experiment using urban traffic scenarios. Participants had to indicate, in a two-step reaction method, the initial supposition and certain anticipation of another car merging into their own lane while being cognitively distracted (high versus low). Retrieval cues that enable the formation of causal relations and the development of a coherent mental representation increased the probability of anticipation. Furthermore, different situational characteristics were identified based on distinct underlying processing patterns. Cues that imply a close relationship with the target's behaviour (target cues) are assumed to require fewer inferences. They were less affected by increased cognitive load compared to other situational characteristics (context cues). These findings enhance the understanding of human anticipation and are discussed regarding the methodological approach and the generalisation of the proposed situational cues.

AB In an automotive society that increasingly depends on cars, the National Police Agency is tackling the problem of operation support of emergency vehicles for incidents, accidents, and other emergency cases in order to manage traffic appropriately. This support of emergency vehicle operations is considered to be one of nine developing fields in Japan's intelligent transportation systems. Recently, to deal with an increasing crime rate, a growing number of accidents, and problems with the elderly, more and more emergency vehicles are being dispatched. Against this background, it is Indispensable for the police administration, as the manager of traffic and as an important instrument for maintaining peace and order, to help emergency vehicles in urgent situations reach the scene at the earliest possible moment and to prevent accidents during operations. Fast emergency preemption systems have a two-way communication function through the use of an infrared beacon, which is the key infrastructure of a traffic control system. Such a system supports the operation of emergency vehicles in a safe and effective manner by using route guidance and priority signal control; it also warns civilian vehicles about approaching emergency vehicles.

AB Older drivers, who are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population, experience high crash rates. An analysis was performed to evaluate potential problem maneuvers that may lead to higher crash involvement. Left turns against oncoming traffic, gap acceptance for crossing non-limited-access highways, and high-speed lane changes on limited-access highways are identified as such maneuvers. Older and younger driver accident propensities are measured, using Kentucky crash data. The findings of the analysis show that older drivers are more likely to be involved in crashes related with these maneuvers compared with younger drivers; older male drivers are safer than older female drivers in left-turn crashes and gap acceptance-related crashes, and having a passenger beside the older drivers makes for a safer driving environment. Potential countermeasures aiming to reduce the accident rates of older drivers are discussed.

AB The location data from positioning devices such as those utilising global navigation satellite system (GNSS) provides vital information for the probe-car systems aiming at solving road-traffic problems. In the case of the Japanese Electronic Toll Collection System 2.0, a huge amount of probe data can be gathered at intervals of 200 m throughout the country. However, it is not easy for conventional map-matching algorithms to perform appropriately when they target this sparse probe data. Since for the sparser probe data of this range, it is required to check the reachability of the probe car between adjacent position fixes by using the Dijkstra's algorithm or A* algorithms. These algorithms, however, consume much computation power and can be a serious obstacle for map-matching processing, especially in real-time applications. The authors propose a new dynamic-programming-based map-matching algorithm, which can also reduce the calculation time for the reachability test by introducing a hash algorithm. The results of the evaluation confirm the robustness and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of both accuracy and computational performance.

AB Understanding how travelers make mobility decisions has always been central to transportation studies. The growing availability of information and communication technologies in everyday life and their role in conveying more recent, relevant, and customized information have substantially changed the context within which trip decisions are made. Whether travelers are actively seeking pretrip information or merely surfing the web, they have access through social media to user-generated information that may affect their mobility decisions. This study forms an exploratory step in understanding how one such social media platform, Yelp.com, designed to allow users to review and rate their experiences at any visited business, can serve as an information source for activity and trip planning in the pretrip process. In particular, the study explored (a) the relative depth, (b) the sentiment associated with, and (c) the type of information in transport-related reviews on Yelp.com. This research has implications for the study of travel behavior in a highly connected environment and can inform efforts to design information and communication technology tools aimed at affecting behavior.

AB An approach to the efficient rendering of terrain surfaces through the use of continuous level of detail but with maintenance of the integrity of added transportation features such as roads, bridges, railways, bus stops, and traffic fights is explored. A quadtree structure was developed to define the terrain surface as a gridded height field and, in the rendering process, to project transportation features in three dimensions onto the terrain surface on the fly. Also, with the viewpoint moving, the connected strips and fans between transportation features and terrain meshes were dynamically adjusted to reduce the projected pixel error. Consequently, the massive terrain and transportation features can be visualized simultaneously in an efficient way. This approach is illustrated with several snapshots, and the efficiency of the algorithms is also demonstrated.

ID INFORMATION; CONGESTION; PROVISION; DURATION; FREEWAY; MODEL
AB This research develops a theoretical model to analyze commuters' joint decisions of route and departure time in a simple network with two parallel routes: one with free but congested lanes, the other with free-flowing tolled lanes with time-varying tolls. By accounting for trip distance, the theoretical model is able to examine the two different sources of travel time uncertainties: length of commute and type of route. Length of commute causes long-distance commuters to leave home earlier, but type of route may lead to a change of route as well as of departure time to compensate for the higher risk of arriving late for work. Results show that long-distance commuters are less likely to take toll lanes than people with short commutes; that travelers who plan to take toll lanes are unlikely to switch to free lanes en route because their later departure times reflect the savings and reduced uncertainty in travel time; and that provision of pretrip information favors the use of toll lanes and may result in commuters leaving home later, even in heavier-than-normal traffic. The theoretical model provides more flexible demand specification for simulation studies. In addition it has important policy implications because it allows a better understanding of commuters' travel behaviors on roads with value-pricing schemes, such as the express lanes on CA-91 and high-occupancy toll lanes on I-15 in California.

AB The distracting effects of a simulated conversation with passengers and those of a conversation over a hands-free cellular phone were compared. The conversation was also analyzed to determine if passengers modulated their conversations as driving demands changed. Eighty participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: driving alone, driving with a passenger, and driving with a cellular phone. Drivers drove through residential and urban traffic environments in a fixed-based driving simulator in which a variety of events occurred, such as pedestrian activity, oncoming vehicles, and intersections. The results indicated that lane and speed maintenance were influenced by increased driving demands. Response times to a pedestrian incursion increased when the driver was driving and talking compared with those detected when the diver was not talking at all. Contrary to what some researchers have assumed, there was little practical evidence that passengers adjusted their conversations to changes in the traffic environment. The workload was rated higher when the driver was driving and talking and was also rated higher by drivers than by nondrivers. The discussion focuses on future research and implications for driver safety and training.

AB The effects of eight in-vehicle tasks on driver distraction were measured in a large, moving-base driving simulator. Forty-eight adults, ranging in age from 35 to 66, and 15 teenagers participated in the simulated drive. Hand-held and hands-free versions of phone dialing, voicemail retrieval, and incoming calls represented six of the eight tasks. Manual radio tuning and climate control adjustment were also included to allow comparison with tasks that have traditionally been present in vehicles. During the drive the participants were asked to respond to sudden movements in surrounding traffic. The driver's ability to detect these sudden movements or events changed with the nature of the in-vehicle tasks that were being performed. Driving performance measures such as lane violations and heading error were also computed. The performance of the adult group was compared with the performance of the teenage drivers. Compared with the adults, the teens were found to choose unsafe following distances, have poor vehicle control skills, and be more prone to distraction from hand-held phone tasks.

ID ROUTE CHOICE BEHAVIOR; MODEL
AB A fuzzy approach to predict online driver routing decisions under information provision is proposed. The problem is characterized by subjectively interpreted and linguistic data, limited data on qualitative variables, and the need for computational efficiency to enable real-time deployment in a traffic control framework. The appropriateness of a fuzzy model to address these characteristics is highlighted. The proposed model enables theoretical consistency with the underlying behavioral mechanisms revealed through the available data. This is done by transforming the probabilities obtained from the data to possibilities, and then constructing membership functions. An S-shaped curve is proposed as a more robust behavioral indicator than the often-used triangular and trapezoidal shapes for these functions, while retaining their analytical tractability, computational efficiency, and ease of construction. In general, the approach suggests membership functions that are consistent with actual data. The model is analyzed using on-site stated preference data on variable message sign driver route diversion attitudes and is compared with a probabilistic discrete choice model for the same data. The results indicate that the fuzzy model performs more robustly for these data. When its computational efficiency and modularity are factored in, it may represent a better alternative to model online driver routing behavior in the context of real-time deployment.

AB A neural network modeling approach is used to identify concrete Specimens that contain internal cracks. Different types of neural nets are used and their performance is evaluated. Correct classification of the signals received from a cracked specimen could be achieved with an accuracy of 75 percent for the test set and 95 percent for the training set. These recognition rates lead to the correct classification of all the individual test specimens. Although some neural net architectures may show high performance with a particular training data set, their results might be inconsistent. In situations in which the number of data sets is small, consistent performance of a neural network may be achieved by shuffling the training and testing data sets.

AB Four assumptions of the Driver/Vehicle Module of the Interactive Highway Safety Design Model were tested against data obtained in two on-road studies of driver behavior. Supported were assumptions that drivers track to the inside of horizontal curves and that a linear control model is adequate for describing steering behavior. Not supported were assumptions of consistent preferred lateral acceleration in horizontal curves and consistent preferred longitudinal accelerations and decelerations during curve approach and exit. Experimental results support (a) an analytically derived square-root relationship between preferred lateral acceleration and curvature and (b) an analytically derived square-root relationship between longitudinal acceleration or deceleration and total speed change.

ID LATERAL CONTROL; DESIGN
AB Several works have proposed longitudinal control strategies enabling a vehicle to operate adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance functions. However, no integration with lateral control has been proposed in the current state of the art, which motivates the developments of this work. This study presents an integrated control strategy for adaptive cruise control with auto-steering for highway driving. An appropriate logic-based control strategy is used to create synergies and safe interaction between longitudinal and lateral controllers to obtain both lateral stability and advanced adaptive cruise control functionalities. In particular, an index is proposed to evaluate lateral motion of the vehicle based on previously published experimental studies on human driving. In order to handle unstable lateral motion of the vehicle, the desired acceleration is determined based on physical limitation in braking with cornering situations. Simulation results show that the proposed integrated controller satisfies the performance in terms of autonomous driving, path tracking and collision avoidance for various driving situations.

AB KLOTS (knowledge-based local traffic safety support) is a Swedish expert system that provides advice on traffic safety problems and countermeasures in urban areas. The system is briefly described and the processes of knowledge collection, verification, and validation used in its development are explained. The user defines a safety problem with input forms. The result from the system is an analysis and a list of countermeasures, each with specific comments that reflect the problem. The principle of presenting a list instead of a single solution is intended to make the user more active in the process of finding an appropriate countermeasure. In practice, KLOTS may be used for providing advice, testing solutions, and making checks. It also may be used for educational purposes. The knowledge in KLOTS was obtained from experts during interviews and is structured in the form of rules for evaluating each problem specified. Development of the system has indicated that the experts must have recent practical experience of traffic safety problems. Presenting real-world cases to the experts and asking them to explain how they would solve them has proved to be the most successful interview technique. It has been possible to achieve a consensus among experts. Extensive testing, verification, and validation are carried out before new versions of KLOTS are released. Both end user validation and knowledge verification are described. Development and widespread use of the system show both the feasibility of constructing knowledge-based systems for traffic safety and a demand for such systems.

AB Driver monitoring is added as a primary safety measure in the EuroNCAP roadmap 2025. Especially with the introduction of automated driving systems into the market, new requirements are set to driver monitoring systems (DMSs). When not being actively involved in driving, the risk of drivers becoming drowsy and even falling asleep at the wheel increases. Modern DMSs will have to be able to detect a driver falling asleep or sleeping in order for the automation to take appropriate actions. Conventional measures for detecting the driver state such as analysing the driving behaviour are not available in automated driving. The aim of the study was to identify potential physiological measures as a basis for the development of systems that are able to detect sleep in drivers during automated driving. A within-subjects study with N = 21 subjects was conducted in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Electromyography, electrodermal activity (EDA), respiration and electrocardiography (ECG) were measured in drivers during states of wakefulness and sleep. Sleep stages were assigned with the electroencephalography as a ground truth. The results indicate the potential of EDA and ECG parameters to differentiate between sleep and wakefulness. Implications for the implementation in DMS are discussed.

AB Computerized crash narratives for the period January 1, 1996, through August 31, 2000, were searched to identify 452 cell phone crashes that occurred in North Carolina. The characteristics of these crashes were compared with about 1,080,000 non-cell-phone crashes during the same period. Cell phone crashes were (a) less likely to result in a serious or fatal injury, (b) nearly twice as likely to be rear-end crashes, and (c) somewhat more likely to occur during the mid-day or afternoon hours. Moreover, cell phone crashes were more likely to occur in urban areas, on local streets, and on roads with "no special feature." Drivers who were talking on a cell phone at the time of the crash were more likely to (a) have committed a driving violation, (b) be driving sport utility vehicles, and (c) be going straight. They were more likely to be male and under age 55. All of these cell phone versus non-cell-phone differences were statistically significant. As cell phones continue to proliferate, the number of cell phone crashes will probably increase. The challenge is to minimize the risks associated with cell phone use and driving, while allowing drivers to enjoy the benefits of cell phones.

AB Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) rapidly migrate towards the Future Internet era, which is characterised, among others, by powerful and complex network infrastructures and innovative applications, services and content. An application area that attracts immense research interest is transportation. In particular, traffic congestions, emergencies and accidents reveal inefficiencies in transportation infrastructures, which can be overcome through the exploitation of ICT findings, in designing systems that are targeted at traffic/emergency management, namely Intelligent Transportation Systems. This study presents such a system that operates on the basis of collecting information from various sources (vehicles and infrastructure objects) through vehicular sensor networks, intelligently processing it, integrating knowledge and experience coming from the past and, finally, issuing directives to the driver for facilitating transportation. The overall approach is presented in detail, whereas a novel heuristic is proposed for the algorithmic process towards reaching decisions. Indicative simulation results showcase its efficiency, mostly with regards to proactively identifying a potential forthcoming danger and accordingly notifying the driver.

AB Current traffic control systems regulate traffic flows only by switching traffic lights according to historical data. Status-prediction and routing services also rely on historical data and as such the accuracy of such predictions cannot be fully relied upon. This paper models the traffic control problem as a multi-agent-multi-purpose system (MAMP) inspired by ant colony optimisation (ACO). Traffic information is collected by the vehicles, rather than fixed roadside infrastructure in this system. Moreover, the information is collected and shared among the vehicles in a distributed manner. The proposed distributed intelligent traffic system (DITS) is implemented in NetLogo and experiments are conducted on two variations of the system, one with ACO, the other without ACO to investigate the impact of ACO on the solution to the traffic problem. Three performance parameters; average speed, average waiting time of vehicles and the average number of stopped vehicles are recorded and studied for different traffic densities and road topologies. The results have shown that for various initial distributions of vehicles, the ACO-strategy obtains higher average speeds, smaller average waiting times and number of stopped vehicles than the non-ACO-strategy. This observation holds for all experiments with different traffic densities and different road network topologies.

TI Connecting Networkwide Travel Time Reliability and the Network
   Fundamental Diagram of Traffic Flow

AB The existence of the network fundamental diagram (NFD) has been established at the urban network scale. It relates three traffic descriptors: speed, density, and flow. However, its deterministic nature does not convey the underlying variability within the network. In contrast, travel time reliability as a network performance descriptor is of growing concern to both the traveling public and traffic managers and policy makers. The objectives of this paper were to extend travel time reliability modeling from the link path level to the network level and to connect overall network variability to NFD. Robust relationships between travel time variability and network density and flow rate were analytically derived, investigated, and validated with both simulated and real-world trajectory data. The distance-weighted standard deviation of travel time rate, as a measure of travel time variability, was found to increase monotonically with network density. A maximum network flow rate existed beyond which network travel time reliability deteriorated at a much faster pace. The results also suggest that these relationships are inherent network properties (signature) that are independent of demand level. The effects of en route information on the proposed relationships were also studied. The results showed that en route information reduced network travel time variability. The findings provide a strong connection between NFD and travel time variability, and this connection can be used further for modeling of network travel time reliability and assessment of measures intended to improve reliability of travel in a network.

AB The transportation infrastructure management sector lacks automated procedures that can help it find and resolve the performance deviations. The objective of this research is to illustrate the mapping of Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) collected photogrammetric data to building information modeling (BIM) parameters, and their application for automated construction progress monitoring and the generation of as-built models. The goal is to support project managers to estimate project progress during highway construction. As a part of ongoing work, this paper takes into account 4D (3D + time) data that is acquired from 3D surface digital elevation models, point clouds, LiDAR data, and orthographic photos. It maps these 4D data onto BIM parameters to create as-built models of the project at different intervals. A comparison between as-planned and as-built models using the earned value management method is employed to develop metrics that can be used for indicating cost and schedule deviations during construction. The mapping methodology introduced in this paper is illustrated using an ongoing highway construction project case study. The main contribution of this paper is the organization, processing, and integration of UAS data with BIM data structures and project management workflows. The research outcomes will assist project managers in an easy and quick identification of potential performance problems and support the project management decision-making process.

AB Constrained cognitive abilities cause imperfections in drivers' choice behaviour and appear largely systematic and predictable. This study introduces the concept of effective control space' to build upon this knowledge as an opportunity to increase the effectiveness of Dynamic Traffic Management (DTM). Within the control space boundaries it is assumed that drivers do not act upon the effects of DTM measures, they behave as being indifferent to them. This study debates that: (i) drivers' ability to detect changes in attributes of their trip or the performance of a traffic system is limited, (ii) drivers make mistakes in estimating the value of such changes and (iii) drivers apply a great diversity of choice patterns but do not necessary adapt their choice. Hence, for some DTM measures to be effective effects should not exceed the control space boundaries, whereas other DTM measures need to give drivers an incentive that exceeds these boundaries. Knowledge on the effective control space may support road authorities to operationalise their measures most effectively. With the theories of indifference bands and decision-making as starting point a theoretical and conceptual framework are provided, supported by a numerical example to demonstrate how application can steer a system towards its optimal state.

AB To evaluate the performance of the advanced driver assistant systems, such as lane departure warning systems (LDWs) and lane keeping assist systems (LKAs), a deep learning model is proposed to estimate the lateral distance between the vehicle and lane boundaries. The training of a deep learning model requires a large number of label images, but the generation of label images is time consuming and boring. Therefore, an improved image quilting algorithm based on a convolutional neural network is proposed. A lot of lane and asphalt pavement images can be synthesised using fewer images of a real road scene. Moreover, an algorithm that aims to automatically generate label images using lane and asphalt pavement images to satisfy the distribution of real scenes is proposed. Experimental results showed that the generated label images can be used to train a deep learning model, and the lateral distance can be estimated with a sub-centimetre precision, which can provide an effective benchmark for the road test of LDWs, LKAs and other driving assistant systems.

AB Although smart-card data secures collective travel information on public transportation users, the reality is that only a few cities are equipped with an automatic fare collection (AFC) system that can provide user information for both boarding and alighting locations. Many researchers have delved into forecasting the destinations of smart-card users. Such effort, however, have never been validated with actual data on a large scale. In the present study, a deep-learning model was developed to estimate the destinations of bus passengers based on both entry-only smart-card data and land-use characteristics. A supervised machine-learning model was trained using exact information on both boarding and alighting. That information was provided by the AFC system in Seoul, Korea. The model performance was superior to that of the most prevalent schemes developed thus far.

AB Given the increasing interest in real-time bus arrival information, producing reliable estimation is essential to maximize the benefits of real-time systems. The primary objectives of this paper are to analyze the changes of bus travel time characteristics as pseudo horizon varies and how such characteristics can be applied to real-time bus arrival estimation. In this study, "horizon" refers to the distance between a real-time bus location and a bus stop, whereas "pseudo horizon" refers to the distance from a GPS point to an upstream GPS point. In contrast to existing methods that provide point estimates of bus arrival times, this study provides interval estimates that take into account the uncertainty of future bus arrival times given that early and late buses have their own respective ramifications. A methodology is developed to analyze the bus travel time distribution systematically based on different pseudo horizons since such distributions are critical to producing reliable bus arrival information. The analysis of real transit GPS data shows a significant change in bus travel time characteristics around a pseudo horizon range of 8 km. The analysis of changes in probability densities with pseudo horizons shows that bus travel time distribution converges from a rightly skewed distribution to a more symmetrical distribution from a shorter to a longer pseudo horizon. Lognormal and normal distributions are found to be the best models for before and after a cut-off horizon of 7-8 km, respectively. Instead of a single distribution, the outcomes of this study suggest a combination of probability distributions based on the estimation horizon to be used to provide better bus arrival time estimations.

ID INTERSECTION; MODEL
AB To complete a permitted left turn successfully, a driver must first correctly assess the adequacy of a gap in the opposing traffic stream. A tendency to reject physically adequate gaps can lead to needless delay, while acceptance of an inadequate gap can lead to a conflict or a collision with an opposing vehicle. Traditional gap acceptance models use time to arrival as the main (and often only) determinant of whether a driver accepts a gap. Human factors research, however, suggests that drivers have difficulty in accurately perceiving time to arrival and that other variables, such as the distance to an oncoming vehicle, may be more salient. In the present study, video extraction methods were used to collect speed, separation distance, and time-to-arrival data for 74 drivers making permitted left turns at an urban intersection. Logit modeling of the drivers' gap choices indicated that distance to the opposing vehicle was the variable most reliably associated with gap selection, with speed and time to arrival making weaker contributions. All of the best models implied that the probability that a driver will accept a gap of a given duration increases as the speed of the oncoming vehicle increases.

AB A study was performed to determine whether drivers who were required to wear a bioptic telescopic lens, (BTL) device while driving posed a greater risk to traffic safety than drivers of similar ages and-the same sex not wearing BTLs. Significance tests were performed to determine the differences between the BTL group and the comparison group on 2-year total accident, fatal or injury accident, and total citation rates. The results indicated that the BTL group-had substantially higher;total and fatal or injury accident rates than the comparison group both before and after statistical adjustment of these criterion measures for age and sex differences between the groups. However, an opposite result was found for total citations: the unadjusted and adjusted rates for the BTL group were significantly lower than those for the comparison group: The driving records of the subjects who use BTLs also showed that only 35% of them had been restricted from driving at night, as required under the department's licensing policy.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Trucks represent the predominant mode of domestic freight movement. Because of the substantial increase in freight truck traffic on the nation's highways, its influence on traffic flow performance, safety, and the quality of the travel experience is receiving increased attention. The behavior of non-truck drivers is modeled in terms of their interactions with trucks in the traffic stream; existing microscopic freeway traffic flow modeling logic is extended to incorporate these interactions; and alternative strategies to mitigate them are evaluated. The car-truck interactions are modeled by associating a "discomfort level" for every non-truck driver in the vicinity of trucks. This discomfort is affected by driver socioeconomic characteristics and situational factors such as time of day, weather, and ambient traffic congestion levels. Stated-preference surveys of non-truck drivers were used to elicit the factors that influence their behavior when they interact with trucks on highways. A fuzzy logic-based model was used to determine non-truck driver discomfort level. The model characterizes non-truck driver behavior near trucks by using if-then rules constructed with the survey data. The discomfort level is used in conjunction with the car-following and lane-changing logics of a traditional traffic flow model to generate a truck-following model and a corresponding lane-changing model. This redresses a key methodological gap in the literature and provides a capability to analyze alternative strategies to mitigate car-truck interactions. An agent-based freeway segment traffic flow simulator was constructed by using these extended microscopic flow models. Simulation experiments with data from the Borman Expressway (I-80 and I-94) in northwest Indiana were used to analyze the sensitivity of the model to the various parameters and evaluate the effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies.

TI Land Suitability Analysis for Emergency Medical Services Posts along
   State Highways: A Case Study of California
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

ID GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; GIS
AB The quicker the response time of emergency medical services (EMS) to road crashes the higher the likelihood of survival. For example, the California Strategic Highway Safety Plan highlights the need to improve the response time and recognizes that 37% and 8% of the fatal crashes are 30 or more miles away from a trauma center in rural and urban areas, respectively. This paper seeks to: (1) demonstrate the viability of using spatial multi-criteria analysis in road safety management; and (2) provide a logical and consistent approach for identifying potential EMS locations. This paper adopted a multi-criteria analysis using the weighted linear combination method on raster data of various impact factors. The area selection criteria were: (1) closeness to probable road fatality locations; (2) distance from existing trauma centers; (3) proximity to existing rest stops; and (4) land availability. An EMS response time of 10minutes, which is 3 minutes shorter than the national average, is used in this paper for demonstration purposes. Note that the specific criterion will be a function of the decision maker's goal. The proposed methodology, which is a first step in identifying potential areas for EMS locations, was demonstrated on information from the state of California. It was found that of the 155,779 square miles of the land area studied, 24% were suitable, 7% were moderately suitable, and 69% were unsuitable for new EMS locations. In general, the rural areas along the west side freeway corridor, linking Los Angeles and San Francisco, are highly suitable.

AB Accurate traffic flow prediction can provide reliable and precise information for traffic departments to formulate effective management measures and assist drivers in performing more intelligent route planning and rerouting. The authors propose a short-term traffic flow forecasting framework for urban expressways based on data-driven mixed models including an approach to traffic flow threshold identification based on an improved semi-supervised K-means clustering algorithm, a hybrid multi-scale traffic speed forecasting method based on wavelet decomposition, and a traffic condition index corresponding to three-phase traffic flow theory for reflecting traffic status in real time. Model performance evaluation is performed using multi-source travel speed data. The results show that the traffic threshold recognition algorithm can correctly identify traffic speed thresholds confirming to the three-phase traffic flow transition and that the proposed short-term estimation technique outperforms traditional auto-regressive integrated moving average models, extended Kalman filtering methods, and artificial neural network models in terms of both accuracy and robustness. The proposed traffic condition index using adaptive thresholds and predicted speeds can provide real-time quantitative surveillance for urban expressway traffic.

AB In this paper, we highlight the conceptual structure of the intelligent transportation systems ( ITS) research field in the period 1992-2011. To do that, an automatic approach for detecting and visualizing hidden themes and their evolution across a consecutive span of years is applied. This automatic approach, which is based on co-word analysis, combines performance analysis and science mapping. To show the conceptual evolution of ITS, three consecutive periods have been defined, i.e., 1992-2001, 2002-2006, and 2007-2011. We have identified that the ITS research has been focused on six main thematic areas, i.e., VEHICLE-AND-ROAD-TRACKING, DRIVER-BEHAVIOR-AND-SAFETY, SCENARIOS-SIMULATION, TRAFFIC-FLOW-AND-TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT, VEHICLE-CONTROL, and VEHICLE-NAVIGATION.

AB The design of an innovative rear-end collision-warning system was evaluated for effectiveness. The crash scenario involves a lead vehicle not moving (LVNM) in one lane of a straight, dry, paved arterial road and a following vehicle approaching in the same lane. The LVNM has a rear-facing sensor and is equipped with the rear crash-warning system, which allows the LVNM to flash its brake lights or its center high-mounted stop lamp, warning the following vehicle that it is approaching too rapidly. Because this problem is complex, the scope was narrowed, and it was assumed that the driver of the following vehicle always detected the warning after a response time lag and then applied hard braking. The warning algorithm (i.e., selecting the most appropriate warning distance for each approaching vehicle speed) was designed based on trade-offs to maximize the capability of preventing crashes, reduce the frequency of nuisance alarms, and minimize the severity of crashes. The overall measures of effectiveness of the warning design were then evaluated for a vehicle speed distribution that represented a suburban arterial road. The findings suggest that the warning system should be very effective in preventing crashes. The expected number of nuisance alarms was small, and for the very small percentage of vehicles that would crash, the expected crash severity was negligible. Experimental studies and field operational tests would be required to obtain more accurate numerical values for the design parameters.

AB Driver Performance Model (DPM) development has provided results reflecting on the debate between on-road and driving-simulator data in driving research. Developed for FHWA, DPM is a computational micro-process model of driver behavior that has been designed to simulate-in detail-the driver's perceptual, cognitive, and control processes to generate steering, braking, and acceleration inputs to the vehicle. The requirement to develop driver data for prediction of absolute on-road performance-versus typical interest in ordinal findings to be later validated via on-road studies-led to the collection of comparable on-road and simulator data and their subsequent comparison. Comparisons of corresponding curve-entry speeds and speed profiles revealed a profound divergence between the on-road and simulator results (t = 9.39, p < .005). Compared with simulator drivers, on-road drivers tended to have higher curve-entry speeds for the more difficult (sharper) curves and lower speeds for the less difficult curves. This trend, though reduced in magnitude, was apparent even after statistical adjustments for differences in respective tangent speeds (t = 2.67,p < .01). These results are discussed in light of emerging on-road and simulator capabilities. The discussion and earlier results altogether supported two conclusions: (a) debate concerning on-road versus simulator research studies is likely to continue with their rapidly emerging individual capabilities, and (b) on-road research currently provides the best basis for driver model development where one-to-one real-world predictions are required (e.g., DPM).

AB An important task during driving is the maintenance of headway during car following. The visual, information available to a driver for successful car following was examined. A model of car following that used the visual angle and change in visual angle of a lead vehicle was developed. The study examined whether information from the surrounding scene (e.g., the roadway and buildings) influenced car-following performance. Licensed drivers were presented with a car-following task in a driving simulator. The simulator display consisted of a roadway scene with a lead vehicle that varied speed according to a sine wave. To evaluate the role of scene information, car-following performance was examined when the surrounding scene was present or absent. Two frequencies and three amplitudes of speed variation were also examined. The results indicated that control gain was greater when the scene was absent, with near unity gain when the scene was present. These findings indicated more accurate control during car following when the surrounding scene information was present. These results suggest that drivers also use other sources of information (e.g., absolute distance information from height in the visual field relative to the horizon and edge rate information specifying observer speed) to maintain headway. The implications of this research to nighttime accident rates and intelligent highway systems are discussed.

AB The car-following process consists of a stimulus-response relationship between vehicles in which the driver of the following vehicle reacts to the actions of the lead vehicle after a time lag. Since the 1950s, the car-following phenomenon has been studied and analyzed, resulting in various models and algorithms. Throughout this period, driver response time lag has always been assumed to be a constant value for the driver at all times, regardless of the approach and level of detail of the model. The primary shortcoming of a constant time lag is that it introduces a number of strong assumptions that do not concur with human nature. To address the problems associated with constant time lag, an independent response time lag module was developed that can be used in any car-following model or algorithm without changing its fundamental mathematical structure. One of the most appealing aspects of this module is its flexible and transparent structure that can easily be adapted to and calibrated for any model or simulation algorithm. The development and structure of the module are described, including the fuzzy definitions of driving states, fuzzy rule extraction, and fuzzy time lag assignment. Statistical and graphical evaluations of the module performance are also included by integrating the module to a proportional car-following model. In the graphical evaluation, the module improved the model performance significantly by providing more precise timing for the driver response. Both Kolmogorov-Smirnov and root-mean-square error tests confirmed that the use of the module improves the car-following model performance.

AB Two-lane freeway exits in which the left-hand exit lane also continues as a through (option) lane are becoming increasingly common. Potential problems can arise at these exits when drivers become confused by the signing and can lead to increases in driver frustration, incidents, and congestion. These problems have not been studied in any detail, especially in circumstances in which the signs recommended in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways cannot be used. Such is the case in the underground sections of I-93 through downtown Boston, Massachusetts, where the signs can be no more than 3 ft high. To arrive at a better understanding of these problems, the Massachusetts Highway Department evaluated a number of different ways of informing drivers that the left-hand lane of a two-lane exit functioned as both an exit lane and a through lane. The entire underground sections of northbound and southbound I-93 were simulated on a computer. Participants in an experiment sat in an actual car surrounded by three screens onto which was projected the virtual world and manipulated the controls of the car just as they would those of an ordinary vehicle. The participants were given a particular destination on each drive. The exact path was recorded, and misses and unnecessary lane changes could be derived from the recording. Six different signs were evaluated in three experiments. A function that could be used to rank the effectiveness of a given sign on the basis of the participants' different responses to the sign was developed. Clear recommendations for the signing of two-lane freeway exits with an option through lane in extreme conditions emerged from the experiments.

AB Although much research into driver attitudes toward and responses to expressway-based variable message signs (VMSs) has been conducted, little research has explored motorist responses to VMSs on arterial surface streets. Arterial VMSs, located near main expressway entrance points, may prove to be more effective at inducing motorists to divert during congestion or incidents than their highway counterparts because they will allow drivers to have many more routing options before they commit to the expressway system. The results of a study conducted in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to discern motorist attitudes toward arterial VMSs and the diversion behaviors induced by those signs are presented. A revealed-preference survey conducted in the immediate vicinity of the arterial VMS found that nearly two-thirds of the respondents obtained traffic information from the signs more than once per week. Furthermore, 66% of those surveyed changed their route at least once per month because of the information received from the arterial VMS. These results demonstrate that motorists are responsive to messages on arterial VMSs; arterial VMSs have an important impact on motorist's travel behavior and are thus a key component in a comprehensive traffic management system. More specifically; an ordered logit model revealed that the propensity to divert was correlated to the frequency that a driver encounters an arterial VMS, motorists' perception of the VMS information as useful, and motorists' trust in the accuracy of the VMS information. The reasons for this diversion response are primarily to save travel time and to avoid expressway incidents..

AB The suitability of a prototype distributed traffic simulation for passing behavior studies was examined. The prototype was based on the High Level Architecture and was designed to combine the microscopic traffic simulation program VISSIM with the driving simulator DriveSafety. Specifically developed for the passing behavior application, the prototype was capable of modeling traffic on two-lane, two-way rural roads. Vehicle information was transferred from the VISSIM federate to the DriveSafety federate to control the creation of vehicles and their speeds. The passing experiment had a repeated-measure, factorial design with two levels of impeding vehicle length and two levels of impeding vehicle speed. Twenty-four test drivers, each with at least 5 years of driving experience, successfully completed a pass under each experimental condition. The passing time and passing distance were observed to be significantly greater when the impeding vehicle was a truck than when it was a passenger car. The mean distance traveled in the left lane and the mean end gap distance were found to be approximately double those reported previously. Likewise, the mean start gap distance was found to be triple that reported previously. These differences were likely due to drivers' propensities to underestimate distances in simulated environments. This study methodology had the advantage of capturing detailed driver information, but concerns about the validity of the methodology and the transferability of the results to the real world warrant further examination.

AB Advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) have huge potential for improving road safety and travel times. However, their take-up in the market is very slow; and these systems should consider driver's preferences to increase adoption rates. The aim of this study is to develop a model providing drivers with the optimal trajectory considering the motorist's driving style in real time. Travel duration and safety are the main parameters used to find the optimal trajectory. A simulation framework to determine the optimal trajectory was developed in which the ego car travels in a highway environment scenario, using an agent-oriented approach. The performance of the algorithm was compared against optimal trajectories computed offline with the hybrid A* algorithm. The new framework provides trajectories close to the optimal trajectory and is computationally achievable. The agents were shown to follow safe and fast trajectories in three tests scenarios: emergency braking, overtaking and a complex situation with multiple vehicles around the ego vehicle. Different driver profiles were then tested in the complex scenario, showing that the proposed approach can adapt to driver preferences and provide a solution close to the optimal solution given the defined safety constraints.

AB The current development of Advanced Rider Assistance Systems (ARAS) would interestingly benefit from precise human rider modelling. Unfortunately, important questions related to motorbike rider modelling remain unanswered. The goal of this study is to propose an original cybernetic rider model suitable for ARAS oriented applications. The identification process is based on experimental data recorded in real driving conditions with an instrumented motorbike. Starting with a dynamic neural network, the proposed methodology firstly presents a non-linear rider model. The analysis of this model and some analogies with car driver modelling allow to deduce a quasi-linear parameter varying (quasi-LPV) rider model with explicit speed dependence and a clear distinction between linear and non-linear dynamics. This quasi-LPV model is further analysed and simplified and finally leads to a rider model with a reduced number of parameters and nice prediction capabilities. Such a model opens up interesting perspectives for the improvement of rider assistances.

AB In recent years there has been increased emphasis in the transportation modeling field on replacing macroscopic supply functions with simulation models. For example, the highway supply relationship in the Transportation Analysis and Simulation System (TRANSIMS) is based on a low-fidelity microsimulation model. How the TRANSIMS low-fidelity highway simulation module compares with a high-fidelity model and with empirical observations from intelligent transportation system (ITS) implementation projects has been examined. A section of Interstate 10 in Houston, Texas, was used as a test bed and ITS data were obtained for calibration and validation purposes. For comparison, the high-fidelity CORSIM model, which is used extensively in North America for operational analyses, was calibrated and tested with the same data. The two models did equally well at replicating the baseline volume data. In addition, the mean travel time output from the calibrated TRANSIMS model tended to be about 20 percent greater than the mean travel time from the calibrated CORSIM model. In general, the observed travel times were found to lie between the simulated values from the TRANSIMS and CORSIM models. More important, the link and corridor travel time variability appeared to be significantly less than the observed travel time variability. It is hypothesized that this difference may affect certain measures of effectiveness, such as automobile emissions, that will be used by transportation planners.

AB Data gathered during a 1996 Intelligent Cruise Control (ICC) Field Operational Test conducted in Michigan and sponsored by NHTSA were analyzed. The purpose was to evaluate driver deceleration and acceleration behavior at stop sign-controlled intersections on rural highways when the driver is unimpeded by a leading vehicle. A novel trip analysis technique was developed to scan the ICC data and identify 299 deceleration and 214 acceleration events at appropriate intersections, and a new mathematical model was used to evaluate those events. This model was used to compute the average rates of deceleration and acceleration for each of these events, and these average rates were compared for different subgroups (e.g., subgroups based on initial speed, final speed, driver gender, and type of street). The results indicate a strong and statistically significant dependence of the deceleration rate on the initial speed but little dependence of these rates on any of the other factors studied. The data indicate that there is a large, random component in the rate of deceleration or acceleration initiated by a driver. This result demonstrates the stochastic nature of driver deceleration and acceleration behavior, which may indicate a need to revisit how deceleration and acceleration rates are treated in common traffic calculations.

AB This study demonstrates through a case study that detailed analyses, even after the construction of a project, are feasible using current technologies and available data. A case study of highway 25 is used to illustrate the method and verify the levels of air contaminants from additionally induced traffic during and after the construction of highway. Natural traffic growth was removed from the effect of observed gas emissions by comparing observed levels on other further locations in the same metropolitan area. This study estimates air pollution from the additional traffic during and after the construction of A-25 extension project. NO2 levels were spatially interpolated during peak and off-peak hour traffic and traffic density simulated on the road network for four scenarios. Comparing the four scenarios, it was found that levels of NO2 concentrations were reduced at neighbor areas due to less traffic during the construction period. Levels of NO2 after the construction were higher than those in 2008. The simulated traffic density for four scenarios revealed that traffic density was significantly increased on both arterial and access roads within the close vicinity of the extension project during and after its construction.

AB Experiments were conducted using a personal computer to study the human factors involved in information processing during route searching. The primary objective was to investigate the effects of differences in the amount of memory retrieval load in terms of a given task. Two route-searching tasks were combined with two memory-reproducing tasks, for four types of tasks. The subjects used either a map guidance system or a voice guidance system to trace a predetermined route to the destination in a simulated driving test. In addition, the subjects were asked to perform memory-reproducing tasks using working memory. In these tasks, the subjects memorized the same number of traffic signs, but there was a difference in the memory retrieval process that the tasks demanded. The subjects were 62 students at Hokkaido University. Multiple analysis of variance was used to analyze the interaction effects and the main effects of tasks. The results indicated that the accuracy of route searching, the response time of route searching, and the accuracy of reproducing memorized traffic signs increased as the memory retrieval load decreased. This suggests that the memory retrieval process affects the performance of drivers' information processing.

AB The driving public's attitude toward acceptable levels of road roughness is explored using empirical data collected on urban highways. Individual driver acceptability levels are matched with international roughness index (IRI) levels to examine the existence of potential user acceptabitity thresholds. In particular, the observed trends are compared with the federal IRI guideline of 170 in./mi (2.7 m/km) for acceptable ride quality recommended by FHWA in its 1998 strategic plan for the National Highway System. The research reported on appears to provide empirical support for the federal IRI guidelines that are already in existence. This study also found that IRI levels provided a very good indication of driver acceptability, which agrees with past research based on antiquated present serviceability ratings.

AB Congestion is a dynamic phenomenon with elements of space and time, making it a promising application of probe vehicles. The purpose of this paper is to measure and visualize the magnitude and variability of congestion on the network scale using smartphone GPS travel data. The sample of data collected in Quebec City contained over 4000 drivers and 21,000 trips. The congestion index (CI) was calculated at the link level for each hour of the peak period and congestion was visualized at aggregate and disaggregate levels. Results showed that each peak period can be viewed as having an onset period and dissipation period lasting one hour. Congestion in the evening is greater and more dispersed than in the morning. Motorways, arterials, and collectors contribute most to peak period congestion, while residential links contribute little. Further analysis of the CI data is required for practical implementation in network planning or congestion remediation.

AB In this paper, we present a case study on planning the locations of public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Beijing, China. Our objectives are to incorporate the local constraints of supply and demand on public EV charging stations into facility location models and to compare the optimal locations from three different location models. On the supply side, we analyse the institutional and spatial constraints in public charging infrastructure construction to select the potential sites. On the demand side, interviews with stakeholders are conducted and the ranking-type Delphi method is used when estimating the EV demand with aggregate data from municipal statistical yearbooks and the national census. With the estimated EV demand, we compare three classic facility location models - the set covering model, the maximal covering location model, and the p-median model - and we aim to provide policy-makers with a comprehensive analysis to better understand the effectiveness of these traditional models for locating EV charging facilities. Our results show that the p-median solutions are more effective than the other two models in the sense that the charging stations are closer to the communities with higher EV demand, and, therefore, the majority of EV users have more convenient access to the charging facilities. From the experiments of comparing only the p-median and the maximal covering location models, our results suggest that (1) the p-median model outperforms the maximal covering location model in terms of satisfying the other's objective, and (2) when the number of charging stations to be built is large, or when minor change is required, the solutions to both models are more stable as p increases.

AB In the near future, Route 1A southbound as it passes around Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, will be rebuilt. The existing four-lane highway will split into three different roadways: two one-lane exits and one two-lane throughway. Drivers will have very little time to decide which lane or lanes to take for a given destination. Given the complex geometry and small warning time, there is some concern that drivers will either miss the Logan exit altogether (leading to a long and frustrating detour around Logan) or make a decision at the last moment to move into the exit lane (leading to a potential safety problem). Proposed and alternative ways of signing exits such as this one with complex multiple splits were evaluated on an advanced fixed-base driving simulator. The virtual roadways and signs were built using the actual engineering design drawings. Drivers sit in a real Saturn and operate the controls of this vehicle just as they would those of a normal vehicle. They are given Logan as their target destination. The alternative freeway guide signs were found to improve indices of driver safety and satisfaction. Specifically, drivers using the alternative signs move into the exiting lane sooner, make fewer double lane changes, and miss their exit less often. The results have implications more generally for the design and testing of highway guide signs using a driving simulator.

AB Railroad engineers are exposed to whole-body vibration and sedentary postural stress while operating locomotives. A self-administered 200-item health survey was distributed. nationwide to a randomly selected group of active railroad engineers (n = 2,546) and a comparison group (civil engineers; n = 798). The response rate was 47% for railroad engineers (n = 1,195) and 41% for controls (n = 323). Back pain lasting more than 1 day per week within the past year was reported by 75% of railroad engineers, whereas it was reported by 41% of the controls [crude odds ratio (OR) = 4.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.31 to 5.64]. In a logistic regression model, by adjusting for age, gender, race, smoking, and non-job-related vibration exposure, the adjusted OR was 4.24 (95% CI = 3.20 to 5.62). The adjusted OR for sciatic pain (a back condition with neurological complications) was 2.17 (95% CI = 1.33 to 3.56). The rates of neck and shoulder problems were also higher among railroad engineers. In conclusion, the survey suggests that railroad engineers have higher rates of back disorders and other health problems than the controls, who have lower levels of exposure to shock and vibration and fewer ergonomic complaints. Better vibration control and ergonomics are probably important factors in preventing back disorders among railroad engineers.

ID STATISTICAL-METHODS
AB The Global Positioning System (GPS) offers new opportunities for the assessment of driving. GPS receivers acquire signals from a constellation of satellites to determine position. By logging position and time data, other kinematic parameters, such as velocity and acceleration, can be derived. Until recently, errors were intentionally introduced to reduce positional accuracy. Without the intentional degradation, it may be possible to use uncorrected data for assessment of driving: Differential correction can be performed by using a reference station to correct errors. GPS was used to determine the position, velocity, and acceleration of a vehicle. The main objectives were to compare corrected and uncorrected positions, velocities, and accelerations. Bland-Altman plots showed about two times as much error in the north-south position or velocity than in the east-west position or velocity when uncorrected data were compared with corrected data: Acceleration data showed no systematic differences between corrected and uncorrected data. Most errors between data sets could be explained by satellite geometry, transitions in the satellites being used, and the direction of travel. The greatest effect of differential correction was on position. Most uncorrected velocity and acceleration data would be acceptable for the assessment of driving. However, if positional information is needed, then correction should be done.

AB Decision making for self-driving cars is usually tackled by manually encoding rules from drivers' behaviours or imitating drivers' manipulation using supervised learning techniques. Both of them rely on mass driving data to cover all possible driving scenarios. This study presents a hierarchical reinforcement learning method for decision making of self-driving cars, which does not depend on a large amount of labelled driving data. This method comprehensively considers both high-level manoeuvre selection and low-level motion control in both lateral and longitudinal directions. The authors firstly decompose the driving tasks into three manoeuvres, including driving in lane, right lane change and left lane change, and learn the sub-policy for each manoeuvre. Then, a master policy is learned to choose the manoeuvre policy to be executed in the current state. All policies, including master policy and manoeuvre policies, are represented by fully-connected neural networks and trained by using asynchronous parallel reinforcement learners, which builds a mapping from the sensory outputs to driving decisions. Different state spaces and reward functions are designed for each manoeuvre. They apply this method to a highway driving scenario, which demonstrates that it can realise smooth and safe decision making for self-driving cars.

AB A new approach for spatial modelling of transport mode choice is presented in the paper. The approach tackles the problem by considering the trade-off between subjective and objective factors. To obtain mode Preference Rates (PRs) based on subjective factors, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is applied. The objective factors are expressed with the journey time from any point in the map to destination according to the available transport mode choice on the specific connection. The results are presented as PRs of individual transport modes. The model is validated on the conducted the survey, with students of Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU) as a target audience. Members of different target groups (age, national, employment) decide differently regarding the transport choice, so it is better to analyse them separately. The presented model can be used for the city transport planning in any urban area. It can help promote the sustainable modes of transport in the areas that are less adjusted in sustainable manner.

AB High-speed rails have a significantly higher driving safety requirement than other public transport because of more passengers and faster speed. However, the particularity of train driving often leads to railway drivers more susceptible to drowsiness and fatigue, and this fatigue has a distinct personality. Here, the authors analyse the mechanism of individual fatigue generation of different drivers, and use eye movement data collected by non-contact means as an objective measurement, and combine subjective sleepiness assessment to reveal the existence of individual differences in fatigue in high-speed railway driving. Furthermore, a novel driver-specific feature weighted support vector machine (FWSVM) algorithm is proposed to handle the individual differences. In the FWSVM, features are assigned with different weights by the information gain to reflect classification importance and individual effects. The average accuracy of FWSVM is 90.98%, the average sensitivity is 92.01%, and the average specificity is 89.88%, which is better than the classical SVM. Such improvements are attributed to the quantitative evaluation of individual effects by the weighted features. These results can be used as a preliminary study to design a high-speed rail vehicle interface to prevent driver fatigue.

AB In this work, the problem of path planning for an autonomous vehicle that moves on a freeway is considered. The most common approaches that are used to address this problem are based on optimal control methods, which make assumptions about the model of the environment and the system dynamics. On the contrary, this work proposes the development of a driving policy based on reinforcement learning. In this way, the proposed driving policy makes minimal or no assumptions about the environment, since a priori knowledge about the system dynamics is not required. Driving scenarios where the road is occupied both by autonomous and manual driving vehicles are considered. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first approaches that propose a reinforcement learning driving policy for mixed driving environments. The derived reinforcement learning policy, firstly, is compared against an optimal policy derived via dynamic programming, and, secondly, its efficiency is evaluated under realistic scenarios generated by the established SUMO microscopic traffic flow simulator. Finally, some initial results regarding the effect of autonomous vehicles' behaviour on the overall traffic flow are presented.

AB Lane detection is the most basic part of automatic driving, driver assistance and violation-detection systems. A lane detection method based on semantic discrimination is proposed to address the problems of diversity in illumination, occlusion and lack of prior knowledge about lane markings. Two symmetric ridge operators are designed to improve the precision of candidate-pixel extraction. The double-constrained random sample consensus method (DC-RANSAC) introduces colour and geometric constraints into the lane fitting to reduce the number of iterations and improve the accuracy of the hypothetical model. Classifiers are added to further validate the hypothetical model and identify its underlying semantics. The proposed method was evaluated using two different data sets with various scenarios, including unclear lane markings, dense traffic, occlusion of vehicles, complex shadows, road surface markings, poor lighting conditions, and unknown number of lane markings. The detailed evaluations show that the detection rate of the proposed method is comparable with that of existing state-of-the-art lane detection methods, whereas the precision rate is much higher. Moreover, the experiments prove the reliability of the proposed algorithm in lane marking semantic recognition.

AB This paper first develops a network equilibrium model with the travel time information displayed via variable message signs (VMS). Specifically, the equilibrium considers the impact of the displayed travel time information on travelers' route choices under the recurrent congestion, with the endogenous utilization rates of displayed information by travelers. The existence of the equilibrium is proved and an iterative solution procedure is provided. Then, we conduct the sensitivity analyses of the network equilibrium and further propose a paradox, i.e., providing travel time information via VMS to travelers may degrade the network performance under some poor designs. Therefore, we investigate the problem of designing the VMS locations and travel time display within a given budget, and formulate it as a mixed integer nonlinear program, solved by an active-set algorithm. Lastly, numerical examples are presented to offer insights on the equilibrium results and optimal designs of VMS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Macroscopic fundamental diagrams (MFD), proposed by Geroliminis and Daganzo, describe the network-wide average relation between the number of vehicles in the network and the output flow of the network. As pointed out by Geroliminis and Daganzo, several factors may influence MFD. The authors study the influence of traveller information on MFDs. The authors use microscopic simulation software TransModeler to model and simulate the dissemination of traveller information as well as the drivers' route choice behaviours that had been affected by the information. The influences of several model parameters, including the informed percentage, the reroute time interval and the acceptable delay level, are also examined. To help preliminarily understand the information's influence, the homogeneity of road sections' density distribution under different model parameters is also investigated. To further understand information's influence, incident information dissemination is investigated as a special case. An iterative model is proposed to depict traffic information's influence on incident-induced congestion propagation. The analysis results are compared with simulation results to validate this model's effectiveness.

TI Estimation of Diversion Rate During Incidents on Basis of Main-Line

ID VARIABLE MESSAGE SIGNS; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; DRIVER RESPONSE; BEHAVIOR
AB A number of intelligent transportation system technologies are deployed for disseminating information to travelers. One of the most important parameters for assessing the impacts and benefits of these deployments that influence route selection is the diversion rates of travelers. In this research, a method was developed to estimate traffic diversions on the basis of main-line detector data without the need for off-ramp detectors. In addition, the estimation allows the assessment of the guidelines and procedures for disseminating information and evaluating the impacts on alternative routes. The validity of the developed methodology was verified by comparing the estimated values with real-world data. Case studies of the developed method indicated that the average diversion rate was about 10% to 35% for three-lane and four-lane freeways, depending on the number of lanes blocked. A linear relationship between the average diversion rate and the lane blockage ratio was also developed; this relationship indicated that there was a general trend of increase in diversion with the increase in the lane blockage ratio.

AB Rural transportation systems have different features and needs than their urban counterparts. To address safety and efficiency concerns in rural environments, advanced rural transportation systems (ARTS) test and deploy appropriate intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technologies, many of which require communication support. However, wireless communication systems that currently serve urban areas often are not available or suitable in rural environments. Thus, a need exists to identify communication solutions that are likely to address successfully the needs and features of ARTS applications. Current and emerging wireless comnumications systems and technologies have been systematically assessed with respect to rural ITS applications. Wireless communication functions associated with rural ITS functions are first identified. Then requirements for applicable communication technologies in the rural environment are defined. Existing and emerging wireless communication systems and technologies are reviewed and evaluated by a systematic process of assessing rural ITS wireless solutions. Finally, recommendations for future research and operational tests are offered. The analysis results are expected to benefit rural ITS planners by identifying suitable wireless solutions for different rural contexts.

AB The study was designed to assess the impacts of cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) on traffic safety. The aim was also to review assumptions made in some previous studies and verify or update the earlier safety estimates. Seven informative C-ITS services warning about various situations and hazards were selected in the study. The expert estimates provided were grounded on new evidence about driver behaviour, the crash categories created in the European Risk Calculation tool (ERiC), and literature. The C-ITS services were assessed to reduce the number of fatalities and injury crashes. The clearly biggest drop in fatalities was assessed for 'In-vehicle signage, speed limit', 'Weather warning' being the second most effective. The next effective were assessed to be 'Warning of emergency braking ahead' and 'Road works warning'. The smallest but still positive impacts were assessed for 'Traffic jam ahead warning', 'Car breakdown warning' and 'In-vehicle signage, child and pedestrian crossing ahead'. Generally, the effectiveness was assessed to be somewhat smaller for injury crashes than fatalities. The authors conclude that the results are positive both for implementing C-ITS services as such and as supporting measure for the deployment of more intervening ITS and automated driving.

ID FEATURE-EXTRACTION
AB Driving behaviour analysis is important for both intelligent transportation and public security. The authors propose to characterise driving behaviours by using the phase-space reconstruction (PSR) and the pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). PSR is first applied to the raw vehicle test data (VTD) to obtain the reconstructed trajectories. Second, the corresponding feature vectors are acquired by using the pre-trained CNN. Third, the t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) algorithm is applied to the feature vectors to validate their characterising ability. Finally, an index is proposed based on the aforementioned feature vectors for quantitative evaluation, i.e. driving style recognition and abnormal driving detection. Simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB Monitoring operations at freight intermodal terminals are useful for estimating their performance, while collecting traffic data allows them to properly manage and control truck flows. Nevertheless, the key role of observation can be in contrast with users' privacy. A valuable solution to obtain traffic information preserving players' anonymity may be provided by scanning radio signals emitted by commonly used on-board devices, which can be locally identified by their unique media access control address. In this solution, no personal, freight or vehicle information is collected. An uncommon application of bluetooth scanners for monitoring operation of truck flows inside terminals is presented, based on a simple methodology for data processing. The algorithm starts from the data collection and the selection of information at relevant points of the terminal, then the network observation is composed by matching the data recorded in connected points. Finally, key performance indicators are estimated, starting from vehicle trajectories, node by node, and their travel time. The method is applied with on-field tests in a large-size rail-road terminal, where the detected counting results are lower than the ground truth, being not all the users equipped with bluetooth devices; however, the pioneering application results replicable in other contexts related to logistics.

AB Rigid activity schedules and pressure of time can strongly influence the determination of a meeting place and time. When several uncertain determinants need to be taken into account, joint activity planning becomes a complex issue. In this respect, a cross-pollination of Migerstrand's time geography and Pawlak's rough set theory yields a fruitful foundation for analyzing multiple agents' travel spaces under uncertainty. This paper reports on an attempt to analyze the effects of uncertain spatiotemporal settings on the determination of interaction spaces. The aim is to provide a better understanding of the uncertainty component of constraints to support agents pointing out a feasible meeting place while respecting individuals' fixed activity programs. The concept of rough space-time prisms and their effect on current space-time accessibility measures is presented. The paper focuses on three types of uncertainty: temporal, spatial, and speed.

ID SYSTEM
AB Warning timing and how drivers with and without forward collision warning (FCW) systems react when distracted at the moment a stationary vehicle is revealed directly ahead were investigated. The study was conducted using the Iowa Driving Simulator (IDS). The IDS was equipped with an FCW system that provided auditory warnings based on two warning criteria. A total of 30 subjects were split across three conditions-a baseline of 10 subjects (no warning display), and two warning conditions (early and late) with 10 subjects each. The two warning conditions differed by the duration of an a priori driver reaction component (1.5 and 1.0 s) in the warning algorithm. Drivers' collision avoidance performance in the two warning conditions was compared with that in the baseline condition. Results indicated that the early warning condition showed significantly shorter accelerator release reaction times, fewer crashes, and less severe crashes than both the baseline condition and the late warning condition. The results indicate that the timing of a warning is important in the design of collision warning systems.

AB Navigating a newly learned route is one of the multiple tasks during automobile driving that competes for a driver's cognitive resources. Stroke, a frequent cause of focal brain damage and cognitive dysfunction, has the potential to impair driving, especially when multitasking is required. The navigational abilities and driving safety errors of stroke patients (in the chronic phase of maximal recovery) were compared with those of healthy control subjects in a route-following task with an instrumented car. All subjects were legally licensed active drivers, and participation was voluntary. All drivers participated in an off-road battery of visual and cognitive tests of abilities that were critical to safe automobile driving. At the onset of the navigational task, each subject was required to recite and learn correctly a brief set of verbal directions to a destination. The main outcome measures were the number of (a) incorrect turns, (b) times lost, and (c) at-fault safety errors during the task. The drivers with stroke made significantly more incorrect turns, got lost more often, and made more at-fault safety errors than the neurologically healthy controls. These significant differences persisted for all outcomes except for getting lost after statistical adjustments for familiarity with the neighborhood. The navigational and at-fault safety errors were predicted by scores on standardized off-road tests sensitive to visual and cognitive declines in drivers with stroke. Drivers with stroke made more navigational and safety errors than neurologically healthy drivers on a route-following task that placed demands on driver memory, attention, and perception. The demands of following route directions probably increased the cognitive load during driving, which may explain the higher number of safety errors.

AB The large-scale trajectory data provide the potential opportunity to a better understanding of driving behaviour for transportation applications and research. However, limited effort has been paid to the study on the evaluation of unsafe driving behaviour (UDB) based on trajectory data. In this work, the authors propose a four-layer processing framework for evaluation of driving behaviour using trajectory data, and first analyse the statistical distribution of various factors and mine UDBs from trajectory data by measuring the deviation from a normal distribution. Then, a membership function is designed to evaluate the severity rating of UDBs, and finally, an analytical hierarchy process-based method is employed to analyse UDBs both qualitatively and quantitatively. With experiments on trajectory data derived from August to September 2018 in Jiangxi, China, vehicles were classified in levels of risk, and the result shows that the proposed method offers a feasible and applicable way for transportation enterprises and drivers to monitor driving behaviour in real-time.

AB This work introduces and evaluates a model for predicting driver behaviour, namely turns or proceeding straight, at traffic light intersections from driver three-dimensional gaze data and traffic light recognition. Based on vehicular data, this work relates the traffic light position, the driver's gaze, head movement, and distance from the centre of the traffic light to build a model of driver behaviour. The model can be used to predict the expected driver manoeuvre 3 to 4 s prior to arrival at the intersection. As part of this study, a framework for driving scene understanding based on driver gaze is presented. The outcomes of this study indicate that this deep learning framework for measuring, accumulating and validating different driving actions may be useful in developing models for predicting driver intent before intersections and perhaps in other key-driving situations. Such models are an essential part of advanced driving assistance systems that help drivers in the execution of manoeuvres.

AB The driver eye scanning study is part of a larger study conducted for the Ohio Department of Transportation to evaluate the effectiveness of ground-mounted diagrammatic guide signs placed before entrance ramps at highway freeway interchanges. This nighttime study investigated driver eye scanning behavior while approaching ground-mounted diagrammatic guide signs placed before entrance ramps. Six highway-freeway interchanges were selected in the Greater Columbus, Ohio, area for placement of the diagrammatic signs in the field. Subjects were six unfamiliar drivers, between the ages of 22 to 42. Two diagrammatic signs were located at each of the six interchanges, .5 mi (805 in) and .25 mi (402 m) before the last point of the gore, where a driver can still gain access to the correct freeway entrance ramp. Driver eye scanning behavior measurements were recorded at night to determine if the presence of the diagrammatic signs elicited an excessive number of eye fixations or was visually distracting to the drivers or both. The results indicate that the diagrammatic signs are not looked at excessively often or excessively long. The average look numbers and average look duration times indicate a normal and reasonable level of information acquisition processing employed by the drivers. These values agree with those previously obtained for regular traffic signing determined in previous eye scanning studies. Ground-mounted diagrammatic signs on multilane arterials in advance of highway freeway interchanges were not demonstrated to unduly distract drivers and detrimentally affect a driver's looking behavior.

AB Activities in the field of automated driving have produced a variety of development tools and methodologies over the past decades. The requirements the systems have to fulfil and thus also the development guidelines are often documented in different kinds of catalogues (use-case catalogues, situation catalogues, scenario catalogues etc.). These catalogues cannot be directly applied for the development of partially and highly automated vehicle guidance concepts like conduct-by-wire (CbW) or H-mode. One reason is that up to now, no consistent terminology known to the authors yet exists for vehicle automation within the community. Moreover, as the aim of the two project groups CbW and H-mode is to make a comprehensive feasibility assessment of cooperative vehicle guidance, all interacting components of the overall system as well as all potential driving conditions a cooperative vehicle guidance system might have to cope with have to be analysed. This article focuses on two aspects. The first is a metaphor-based terminology discussion leading to a proposal for a fundamental ontology. The second aspect is an outlook on the different catalogues that use the new terminology and that have been developed. The methodology introduced here is a fundamental contribution towards simplifying communication and the exchange of findings.

AB Classical artificial potential approach of motion planning is extended for emulating human driving behaviour in two dimensions. Different stimulus parameters including type of ego-vehicle, type of obstacles, relative velocity, relative acceleration, and lane offset are used. All the surrounding vehicles are considered to influence drivers' decisions. No emphasis is laid on vehicle control; instead, an ego vehicle is assumed to reach the desired state. The study is on human-like driving behaviour modelling. The developed motion planning algorithm formulates repulsive and attractive potentials in a data-driven way in contrast to the classical arbitrary formulation. Interaction between the stimulus parameters is explicitly considered by using multivariate cumulative distribution functions. Comparison of two-dimensional (lateral and longitudinal) performance indicators with a baseline model and generative adversarial networks indicate the effectiveness and suitability of the developed motion planning algorithm in the mixed traffic environment.

AB This paper presents a new decision tree induction method, called co-location-based decision tree (CL-DT), to enhance the decision-making of pavement maintenance and rehabilitation strategies. The proposed algorithm utilizes the co-location characteristics of spatial attribute data in the pavement database. The paper first presented the co-location mining algorithm, including spatial attribute data selection, determination of rough candidate co-locations, determination of candidate co-locations, pruning the non-prevalent co-locations, and induction of co-location rules, and then focused on the development of the co-location decision tree (CL-DT) algorithm, which includes the non-spatial attribute data selection, co-location algorithm modeling, node merging criteria, and co-location decision tree induction. A pavement database covering four counties, which are provided by North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT), is used to verify the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrated that (1) the proposed CL-DT algorithm can make a better decision, and has higher accuracy than the existing decision tree methods do; (2) the training data can be fully played roles in contribution to decision tree induction and the computational time taken for the tree growing, tree drawing and rule generation is largely decreased; (3) quantity and locations of six treatment strategies proposed by the ITRC and by CL-DT is much close for each treatment strategy.

AB At present, a number of smart urban mobility solutions exist and furthermore are emerging towards the design of smart cities offering equitable, green and efficient transport. As this concept addresses the needs of all travellers, it is essential to explore the relevance of existing and proposed smart solutions for distinct user categories. Powered-two-wheelers (PTWs) comprise a distinct vehicle category exhibiting specific movement dynamics and characteristics while exhibiting considerable presence in urban areas and increasing ownership trends during the recent years. Thus, PTW needs should be identified and considered in the design of smart cities. This study explores PTW diversion behaviour considering variable message signs (VMS) operation. Relevant data was collected through a stated preference questionnaire survey and diversion propensity was explored through the design of probit models. Survey results indicated that although PTWs believe that VMS fail to address their needs, their attitudes towards them are still positive. Model results exhibited that most of the information elements transmitted via VMS affect PTW diversion behaviour. Other contributory factors, considering PTW diversion included traffic code violation behaviour, rider 'flexibility', age, gender etc. Rider sub-populations, considering riding on the pavement or pedestrianised areas and internet use for traffic information, were also explored.

AB Studies that explore drivers' decision behaviour under the graphical route information panels (GRIPs) via the discrete choice models have rarely been reported. In this paper, drivers' route choice response to the GRIPs is quantitatively analysed by using the discrete choice models through a case study of a real-life GRIP in Shanghai, China. A logit model for predicting the route choice probabilities is developed to capture the relationship between the route choice probability, the driver attributes and the GRIP messages, respectively. The modelling results show that the drivers who have a larger annual driving mileage, access the traffic information via the electronic message signs in daily life highly value the GRIPs and drive their car mainly for the commuting purpose are more likely to divert from the original route to the alternate route under the GRIP; a driver's perceived delay of the original route has a positive effect on his diversion decision under the GRIP; there exist differences in the GRIP response behaviour; the drivers are more likely to divert when the GRIP displays red' to indicate severe congestion on the original route; the female drivers are more sensitive to red' and more likely to divert.

AB Studies on on-road behaviour imply that designing user-centred services is important for raising awareness about severe weather and adverse road conditions. Along with the developments of new communication technologies and practices, the research area of ITS is challenged to move on from traditional ways of collecting and distributing traffic weather information. This study presents two methods for potential improvements and personalisation of traffic weather information. The methods were demonstrated and evaluated by 440 respondents in Stockholm. Weather alerts were sent by SMS 12-48 h, up to a week, prior to the occurrence of severe weather events during 2008-2010. The service was personalised because of assumptions regarding perception and memory of weather, including user's recent observations. The second aspect of potential improvement was the introduction of a social network component, including user-generated local weather observations. The impact of the service was evaluated in a longitudinal study through a series of questionnaires on user behaviour and evaluation of the service. The combination of the two methods proved efficient as the amount of changed decisions was of considerable amplitude. A correlation between time of exposure and changed decisions implies that social components and interactivity may be a powerful tool in traffic weather services and ITS.

AB The rapid progress of information technology (IT) may provide us with new insights into understanding traffic phenomena, and could help mitigate traffic problems. One of the key applications of IT to traffic and transport analysis is the identification of the location of moving objects using the Global Positioning System (GPS). It is expected that detailed traffic analysis could be carried out using these data. In this article, we first summarize the various applications of probe data in transport analysis. GPS data are merely a sequence of locations, and further data transformation such as map-matching, data-reduction, processing, and reporting is needed to use them effectively. We then discuss the application of bus probe data to evaluating travel time variability and the level of service (LOS) of roads. A methodology for evaluating the road network from the viewpoint of travel time stability and reliability using bus probe data is proposed. Travel time distributions of arbitrary routes are estimated by statistically summing up directly observed multiple travel time distributions. Based on the development of methodologies to estimate travel time distributions of arbitrary routes covered by the bus probe survey, this study proposes an approach to evaluate the LOS of road networks based on the concept of travel time reliability.

ID INTEGRATION; PERFORMANCE
AB Competence Assurance Solutions Ltd. (CAS) produced the Good Practice Guide in 2000, the first version of Railway Safety's Good Practice Guides for strategic safety management. The guides and accompanying software contain a self-assessment process that enables the top management teams of railway companies to determine whether the team and the organization are sufficiently competent to discharge their strategic safety. management responsibilities. To support the Good Practice Guides, CAS provides, on behalf of the Rail Safety and Standards Board (which succeeded Railway Safety on April 1, 2003), a mentoring process to guide top management teams through the self-assessment process. The findings and conclusions from the ongoing mentoring process are presented. At present, 27 leading U.K. rail companies are being mentored. They are in different stages of the process, although many have completed a self-assessment in all four of the key strategic areas considered: policy and strategy, risk assessment and control, organizational resourcing and support, and operational control. Already, a pattern has emerged among those companies that have completed the assessment. Almost all consider themselves stronger in the areas of strategy and policy and operational control and weaker in the areas of risk control and resourcing and support. The weaknesses are particularly marked for human factors. Furthermore, companies differ significantly in their self-ratings, with these differences being reflected in some aspects of safety performance. Consideration is given to the safety issues that dominate the minds of senior teams, their areas of strength and weakness, the characteristics of high- and low-scoring companies, and the sources of unrealistic self-assessments.

AB This study explores the limiting properties of network-wide traffic flow relations under heavily congested conditions in a large-scale complex urban street network; these limiting conditions are emulated in the context of dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) experiments on an actual large network. The primary objectives are to characterize gridlock and understand its dynamics. This study addresses a gap in the literature with regard to the existence of exit flow and recovery period. The one-dimensional theoretical Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD) only represents steady-state behavior and holds only when the inputs change slowly in time and traffic is distributed homogenously in space. Also, it does not describe the hysteretic behavior of the network traffic when a gridlock forms or when network recovers. Thus, a model is proposed to reproduce hysteresis and gridlock when homogeneity and steady-state conditions do not hold. It is conjectured that the network average flow can be approximated as a non-linear function of network average density and variation in link densities. The proposed model is calibrated for the Chicago Central Business District (CBD) network. We also show that complex urban networks with multiple route choices, similar to the idealized network tested previously in the literature, tend to jam at a range of densities that are smaller than the theoretical average network jam density. Also it is demonstrated that networks tend to gridlock in many different ways with different configurations. This study examines how mobility of urban street networks could be improved by managing vehicle accumulation and redistributing network traffic via strategies such as demand management and disseminating real-time traveler information (adaptive driving). This study thus defines and explores some key characteristics and dynamics of urban street network gridlocks including gridlock formation, propagation, recovery, size, etc. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ID TRAFFIC FLOW
AB A model was formulated for estimating dynamic origin-destination (O-D) travel time and flow on a long freeway with a neural Kalman filter originally developed by the authors. The model predicts O-D travel times and flows simultaneously by using traffic detector data such as link traffic volumes, spot speeds, and off-ramp volumes. The model is based on a Kalman filter that consists of two equations: state and measurement. First, the state and measurement equations of the Kalman filter were modified to consider the influence of traffic states for some previous time steps. Then artificial neural network models were integrated with the Kalman filter to enable nonlinear formulations of the state and measurement equations. Finally, a macroscopic traffic flow simulation model was introduced to simulate traffic states on a freeway in advance and predict traffic variables such as O-D travel times, link traffic volumes, spot speeds, and off-ramp volumes. The new model was compared with a regression Kalman filter in which the state and measurement equations are defined by regression models. The numerical analysis indicated that the new model was capable of estimating nonlinearity of dynamic O-D travel time and flow and helped to improve their estimation precision under free-flow traffic states as well as congested flow states.

AB Seaports represent a major component of multimodal transport networks and they are key in the operation of supply chains and global logistics. In multimodal transport networks it is well acknowledged the use of information and communication technology (ICI') can deliver benefits that include real time track and trace, visibility and reduced lead-time, among others. Given the importance of the benefits associated to the adoption of ICT in the operation of multimodal transport networks, this work uses institutional-related theories in a multiple-case study comprising seven seaports terminals located in two continents. The purpose of the study is to identify key elements that affect and influence the adoption of ICT to support interoperability and connectivity in multi-modal seaport terminal operations. The analysis is used to identify groupings of influence linked to elements comprising institutional-related theories like coercion and mimesis, part of institutional isomorphism, among others. The study shows that both government legislation and dominant organizations running ports in various geographical locations exert great influence regarding ICT adoption policies in seaport terminals. The adoption of ICT has become important given the proliferation of technologies, the increasing need for track and trace capabilities and the economic impact of seaports terminals.

AB The most common mode for en-route public traveller information is dynamic message signs (DMSs). Despite their effectiveness, they are costly and limited in the amount of information they can deliver. The wide availability of smart mobile devices and communication technologies offers possibilities to provide traveller information not only through in-vehicle devices without incurring huge infrastructure costs, but also in a more flexible manner to selected individuals and at specific locations without geographical constraints. This study proposed the concept of virtual DMSs (VDMSs) to improve public traveller information provision. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of such systems, the study first prototyped a smartphone-based VDMS application and conducted a focused group user experience survey, which revealed a positive attitude towards VDMS in terms of both usefulness and satisfaction. Second, a driving simulator study was conducted to analyse two other critical aspects of VDMS, message comprehension and driver distraction. Results revealed that VDMS generally performs better than DMS across different amounts of information provision and under different driving conditions regardless of driver age. It is recommended that transportation agencies give full consideration to VDMS as a future strategy for delivering public traffic information in a connected vehicle environment.

AB This study demonstrates the need for a holistic safety-impact assessment of an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) and its effect on eye-glance behaviour. It implements a substantial incremental development of the what-if (counterfactual) simulation methodology, applied to rear-end crashes from the SHRP2 naturalistic driving data. This assessment combines (i) the impact of the change in drivers' off-road glance behaviour due to the presence of the ADAS, and (ii) the safety impact of the ADAS alone. The results illustrate how the safety benefit of forward collision warning and autonomous emergency braking, in combination with adaptive cruise control (ACC) and driver assist (DA) systems, may almost completely dominate the safety impact of the longer off-road glances that activated ACC and DA systems may induce. Further, this effect is shown to be robust to induced system failures. The accuracy of these results is tempered by outlined limitations, which future estimations will benefit from addressing. On the whole, this study is a further step towards a successively more accurate holistic risk assessment which includes driver behavioural responses such as off-road glances together with the safety effects provided by the ADAS.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the capability to acquire real-time information from each other while human-driven vehicles (HVs) are standalone in the vehicle roadway navigation system. The information asymmetry poses significant challenges in managing and controlling vehicles in mixed traffic. To address such challenges, this study first customises the intelligent driver model to describe the car-following behaviour of CAVs. Furthermore, to raise the traffic efficiency of the mixed traffic flow, a new lane-changing decision support algorithm is proposed, which incorporates the interaction between CAVs and HVs by controlling the speed and locating the lane of CAVs. In addition to the common indexes of outflow and travel time to be used to measure the travel efficiency, new parameters such as platoon intensity and single rate are defined to evaluate the CAV platooning capability. Through simulation tests, the proposed controlling framework is implemented for a two-lane (per direction) freeway segment under different CAV penetration rates and input volumes. The simulation results indicate that, at all the CAV penetration levels, the proposed controlling algorithm provides significant performance improvements to the whole mixed traffic flow in terms of outflow, travel time, and the number of CAV platoons.

AB A general structure of stimulus-response formula is presented to specify the interacted network dynamics under the assumption of a daily learning and adaptive travel behavior. By taking the time derivative of system variable as a response term, the evolution is formulated as a dynamic system. Issues of existence, uniqueness, and stability for the proposed differential equations are briefly discussed. Approximation of a time-varying route-choice model is derived from the addressed path-flow dynamics. Threshold effects on path-flow dynamics are encapsulated into the proposed general structure by incorporating a discontinuous stimulus term. Then, the quasi user equilibrium is achieved when all users feel indifferent between the experienced and predicted travel time provided by intelligent transportation systems, i.e., the whole system dynamics stay within a bounded range. The derived quasi user equilibrium is reduced to Wardrop's user equilibrium as the threshold effects of path-flow dynamics vanish.

AB The performance of map matching has a significant effect on obtaining real-time traffic information. The floating car data (FCD) is of low-sampling rate, and urban road networks such as multi-layer roads can be particularly complex. Most of the current low-sampling-rate map-matching approaches use a fixed time interval, which can result in a lack of efficiency and accuracy if the initial point is not correctly matched. Moreover, the issue of handling data relating to multi-layer road networks remains open. To address these issues, a new on-line map-matching framework is proposed, comprising the confidence point and the maximum delay constraint dynamic time window. The framework performs map matching by self-adaptively choosing the appropriate timing and matching method according to the complexity of the local network to which the positioning point belongs. To distinguish elevated roads from normal roads, vehicle behaviour patterns on elevated roads are taken into account. Comparisons of the proposed algorithm, hidden Markov model algorithm, incremental algorithm and point-to-curve algorithm are conducted on two datasets. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other algorithms. When the behaviour pattern on elevated roads is considered, the accuracy of these algorithms is also improved.

AB A major objective for providing real-time traffic information to drivers is to improve the efficiency of the road network, especially in incident situations. However, the subsequent effects depend on behavioral response, in both interpreting available information and reacting to it. Research focusing on the use of variable message signs (VMSs) was done in the urban network of Southampton, in the United Kingdom, a site chosen because of the innovative large-scale application of an urban VMS system and the availability of traffic data derived from urban traffic controls using the split-cycle offset optimisation technique (SCOOT) and other detectors. Although previous research regarding VMSs located in inter-urban areas such as motorways is well documented, the use of VMSs within urban areas is not widespread. The research analyzed several case studies by using detector data collected during incident scenarios at seven locations to assess driver response to VMS messages in terms of diversion rates. Positive driver responses were measured for all, with diversions ranging from 2% to 30%, although not all were solely attributable to VMS information. No relationships between the severity of VMS message and driver response could be identified. A simulation model was then used to quantify the potential network benefits of traffic information. A main finding was that if the diversionary route had sufficient spare capacity, substantial VMS benefits were potentially attainable, although these benefits were not distributed equally.

AB It is well established in the literature that secondary tasks adversely affect driving behavior. Previous research has focused on discovering the general trends by analyzing the average effects of secondary tasks on a population of drivers. This paper conjectures that there may also be individual effects, i.e., different effects of secondary tasks on individual drivers, which may be obscured within the average behavior of the population, and proposes a model-based approach to analyze them. Specifically, a radial-basis neural-network-based modeling framework is developed to characterize the normal driving behavior of a driver when driving without secondary tasks. The model is then used in a scenario of driving with a secondary task to predict the hypothetical actions of the driver, had there been no secondary tasks. The difference between the predicted normal behavior and the actual distracted behavior gives individual insight into how the secondary tasks affect the driver. It is shown that this framework can help uncover the different effects of secondary tasks on each driver, and when used together with support vector machines, it can help systematically classify normal and distracted driving conditions for each driver.

AB Rapid economic growth and urbanization have motivated economists and researchers to seek innovative solutions for the many challenges that accompany these trends. This can be observed in upcoming research in sustainable transportation services where potential solutions to urban mobility issues are being explored. For example, e-carsharing, which involves the joint ownership or use of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) does not only mitigate the environmental and infra structural hazards of privately owned internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) through reduction of emissions and urban traffic, but also alleviates many barriers such as high costs, battery life limitations, and suboptimal charging infrastructures that have prevented privately owned BEVs from reaching their full potential.
   In response, we present a framework for a battery electric vehicle utilization management system (BEVUMS) for automated optimization of operational decisions regarding the usage of electric vehicles in mixed vehicle-type fleets. The framework consists of four modules: energy demand prediction, battery charge scheduling, vehicle selection, and vehicle relocation. We assess the validity and capabilities of the system by simulating an e-carsharing system with data sets of 2,000 and 20,000 vehicle rental data points. Our findings suggest opportunities for prevention of charging related problems, increased BEV rental ratios, and lengthened BEV rental periods. Thus, the proposed system leads to improved BEV utilization and prolonged BEV battery life. In addition to these opportunities for increased potential sustainability provided by our proposed BEVUMS, this study further contributes to current research in the field by providing a framework and a benchmark setting for future research.

AB Vehicle detection and distance estimation are critical components of driver assistance system and self-driving system, and considerable different frameworks have been investigated such as radar, laser and camera-based. Among them, camera-based vehicle detection and distance estimation have an obvious advantage over other systems in that it needs lower cost. However, existing camera-based methods are not robust enough under complex driving scenes. In this work, an end-to-end deep convolutional neural network framework is proposed to jointly detect vehicles and estimate vehicle distance efficiently. Specifically, a monocular depth estimation method is designed to transform the RGB appearance information into depth modality information. Then the vehicle detection module takes the RGB and depth image as inputs to improve the detection performance. Finally, the distance estimation module employs the detection results and the estimated depth information to predict the distance more precisely. The whole network can be trained in an end-to-end manner with the multi-task loss function. The proposed framework is evaluated on the public vehicle detection benchmark KITTI to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Moreover, the performance of three proposed sub-modules are also analysed separately to give a more comprehensive evaluation of the designed framework.

AB Advancements of information, communication and location-aware technologies have made collections of various passively generated datasets possible. These datasets provide new opportunities to understand human mobility patterns at a low cost and large scale. This study presents a home-based approach to understanding human mobility patterns based on a large mobile phone location dataset from Shenzhen, China. First, we estimate each individual's "home" anchor point, and a modified standard distance () is proposed to measure the spread of each individual's activity space centered at this "home" anchor point. We then derive aggregate mobility patterns at mobile phone tower level to describe the distance distribution of for people who share the same "home" anchor point. A hierarchical clustering algorithm is performed and the spatial distributions of the derived clusters are analyzed to highlight areas with similar aggregate human mobility patterns. The results suggest that 43 % of the population sample travelled within a short distance () during the 13-day study period while 23.9 % of them were associated with a large activity space (). The geographical differences of people's mobility patterns in Shenzhen are evident. Areas with a large proportion of people who have a small activity space mainly locate in the northern part of Shenzhen such as Baoan and Longgang districts. In the southern part where the economy is highly developed, the percentage of people with a larger activity space is higher in general. The findings could offer useful implications on policy and decision making. The proposed approach can also be used in other studies involving similar spatiotemporal datasets for travel behavior and policy analysis.

ID ATTENTION; YOUNG
AB Express routes in North America are becoming more crowded, both in traffic density and in visual clutter. Higher demand for driver attention is a possible concern for regulators. Advertising signs add to this demand on visual attention. This study focused on the glance behavior of 25 drivers at various advertising signs along an expressway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The average duration of the glances for the subjects was 0.57 s [standard deviation (SD) = 0.41], and in total there was an average of 35.6 glances per subject (SD = 26.4). Active signs that contained movable displays or components made up 51% of the signs and received significantly more glances (69% of all glances and 78% of long glances). The number of glances was significantly lower for passive signs (0.64 glances per subject per sign) than for active signs (greater than 1.31 glances per subject per sign). The number of long glances was also greater for active signs than for passive signs. Sign placement in the visual field may be critical to a sign being noticed or not. Empirical information is provided to assist regulatory agencies in setting policy on commercial signing.

AB Environmental considerations mean that continuing to use internal combustion is, in the long term, unviable because of availability and cost of the fuel and the environmental effects of their emissions. If full electric vehicles (EVs) are to be a more sustainable method of transport then some of the perceived problems of EVs must be addressed, such as range anxiety' and technical performance'. To do this it is necessary to understand how drivers behave in EVs, both through their overall trip statistics and their driving behaviour within trips. This has been achieved in this project through instrumenting the EVs with a direct link to the vehicle's controller area network bus, a global positioning system and a networked link to an always on database. Through analysis of the vehicle data, it has been possible to build up a quantitative picture of how the vehicles are typically used. Quantitative examples include trip lengths, trip efficiency correlated to the braking techniques and general driving behaviour changes such as improved efficiency at low battery levels. From this study it can be shown that it is possible to monitor EVs and selectively produce derived statistics which can be used to analyse the behaviour of drivers.

AB Driver's intention is a self-internal state that represents a commitment to carrying out driving action at the next moment, which could be affected by driver's emotion. Therefore, understanding driver's emotion is an important basis for developing driver intention recognition models. This study aims to gain a better insight of the characteristics of driver intention transition trigged by driver's emotion. The Hidden Markov model was used to develop a driver intention recognition model with the involvement of driver's emotions. Assorted materials including visual, auditory and olfactory stimuli were used to evoke driver's emotions before the driving experiments, as well as keep and increase the emotional level during driving. Real and virtual driving experiments were conducted to collect human-vehicle-environment dynamic data in two-lane roads. The results show that the proposed model can achieve high accuracy and reliability in estimating driver's intention transition with the evolution of driver emotion. Our findings of this study can be used to develop the personalized driving warning system and intelligent human-machine interaction in vehicles. This study would be of great theoretical significance for improving road traffic safety.

ID GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION
AB The year 2020 has marked the spread of a global pandemic, COVID-19, challenging many aspects of our daily lives. Different organizations have been involved in controlling this outbreak. The social distancing intervention is deemed to be the most effective policy in reducing face-to-face contact and slowing down the rate of infections. Stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders have been implemented in different states and cities, affecting daily traffic patterns. Social distancing interventions and fear of the disease resulted in a traffic decline in cities and counties. However, after stay-at-home orders ended and some public places reopened, traffic gradually started to revert to pre-pandemic levels. It can be shown that counties have diverse patterns in the decline and recovery phases. This study analyzes county-level mobility change after the pandemic, explores the contributing factors, and identifies possible spatial heterogeneity. To this end, 95 counties in Tennessee have been selected as the study area to perform geographically weighted regressions (GWR) models. The results show that density on non-freeway roads, median household income, percent of unemployment, population density, percent of people over age 65, percent of people under age 18, percent of work from home, and mean time to work are significantly correlated with vehicle miles traveled change magnitude in both decline and recovery phases. Also, the GWR estimation captures the spatial heterogeneity and local variation in coefficients among counties. Finally, the results imply that the recovery phase could be estimated depending on the identified spatial attributes. The proposed model can help agencies and researchers estimate and manage decline and recovery based on spatial factors in similar events in the future.

AB Understanding passenger loyalty to public transit is important because it is a major determinant of urban and transport sustainability. An integrated framework to investigate loyalty by integrating Satisfaction-Loyalty Theory with Expectation-Confirmation Theory (ECT) is conceptualized and empirically examined in this study. A hierarchical structure is established to characterize the multidimensional features of public transit services from the passengers' point of view, which might help service providers obtain a systematic picture of public transit services by measuring overall service performance through sub-dimensional service domains. The rationale for developing this comprehensive framework for customer loyalty is justified by the significant relations between constructs, an excellent model fit, the greater share of variance explained for loyalty than that of the model without the two ECT concepts, as well as the difference regarding the confirmation-satisfaction-loyalty paradigm between male and female groups. It is expected to contribute to an improved understanding of customer loyalty in the public transit services context.

AB In Japan, although the rapid aging of the population has caused serious traffic problems, only a few studies have investigated the behaviour of elderly drivers in real traffic conditions. The authors have been developing a system to automatically evaluate safe-driving skill through small wireless wearable sensors that directly measure the driver's behaviour. The authors aim is to promote safe driving by providing a personalised training program according to the individual's own shortcomings in driving behaviour. By employing the sensors together with GPS and driving instructors' knowledge, our system can automatically identify shortcomings in driving skill with an accuracy of over 80%. In February 2010, the Kyoto Prefecture Public Safety Commission, in Japan, certified our system as the first and only support tool for its mandatory retraining course for elderly drivers' that all elderly drivers, aged over 70 years, are required to take when renewing their driver's license. In this study, the authors discuss the effectiveness of our system and investigate elderly drivers' behaviour through a large-scale demonstration experiment, involving 749 elderly drivers, in the mandatory driver-retraining course on public roads. The authors results reveal that although elderly drivers are able to maintain a safe vehicle speed, their tendency to not scan around their vehicle to ensure safety makes their driving risky.

AB With the advancement of location acquisition technologies, a large amount of raw global positioning system (GPS) trajectory data is produced by many moving devices. Learning transportation modes from the GPS trajectory data is an important problem in the domain of trajectory data mining. Traditional supervised learning-based approaches rely heavily on data preprocessing and feature engineering, which require domain expertise and are time consuming. The authors propose a deep learning-based convolutional long short term memory (LSTM) model for transportation mode learning, in which the convolution neural network is first used to extract deep high-level features and then LSTM is used to learn the sequential patterns in the data that uses both GPS and weather features, thus making the full use of spatiotemporal operations. The authors have also analysed the impact of the geospatial region on human mobility. Experiments conducted on the Microsoft Geolife data set fused with the weather data set show that their model achieves the state-of-the-art results. The authors compare the performance of their model with the benchmark models, which shows the superiority of their model having 3% improvement in accuracy using only GPS features, and the accuracy is further improved by 4 and 7% on including the impact of geospatial region and weather attributes, respectively.

AB Traffic information prediction is one of the most essential studies for traffic research, operation and management. The successful prediction of traffic speed is increasingly significant for the benefits of both road users and traffic authorities. However, accurate prediction is challenging, due to the stochastic feature of traffic flow and shallow model structure. Furthermore, environmental factors, such as rainfall influence, should also be incorporated to improve accuracy. Inspired by deep learning, this paper investigates the performance of deep belief network (DBN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to conduct short-term traffic speed prediction with the consideration of rainfall impact as a non-traffic input. The deep learning models have the ability to learn complex features of traffic flow pattern under various rainfall conditions. To validate the performance of rainfall-integrated DBN and LSTM, the traffic detector data from an arterial in Beijing are utilised for model training and testing. The experiment results indicate that with the combination input of speed and additional rainfall data, deep learning models have better prediction accuracy over other existing models, and also yields improvements over the models without rainfall input. Furthermore, the LSTM can outperform the DBN to capture the time-series characteristics of traffic speed data.

AB Both the risk of concentration phenomenon for the navigation system and the risk of encountering unacceptable delay are reduced by guiding risk-averse drivers along reliable paths while avoiding high-risk links as far as possible. A constrained dynamic A* algorithm is proposed to search for a reliable path subject to a trip duration constraint in a time-dependent road network. The efficiency of the dynamic A* search is increased by taking advantage of information computed off-line. The algorithms proposed are implemented, and their computational performance is analyzed in simulation.

AB High-speed rail (HSR) networks require large investments, and the performance of the infrastructure is affected by varying local environments, while subject to tight layout restrictions. This paper presents a fully integrated three-dimensional model to optimize the HSR alignment at a planning scale, which sets boundaries for the final project design. The model considers mandatory and desirable specifics for the locations to link and the geometry in both the plan view and the longitudinal profile. It also allows one to define prohibited and restricted land-use areas. A computational tool has been developed that takes into account the problem specifics using a simulated annealing algorithm to optimize the problem solution. The capabilities of the model and the tool are demonstrated with the application to an intentionally simple and synthetic case study, considering construction costs and problem constraints, for which sound results are obtained. Both the model and the tool can be expanded to incorporate additional complexity, establishing the basis for real applications and for further integration of geotechnical and hydrological risk factors that affect the HSR performance.

AB Car-sharing economy has caused new driving safety and usability problems, which have not been well studied. This study aims at analyzing the effects of users age and the user experience (UX) of the car-sharing software (e.g., DiDi travel app) on overall usability and the level of distraction for drivers. To this end, 48 experienced Chinese drivers were recruited to perform various tasks with the car-sharing software using a driving simulator. The variables of driving safety and usability were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and independent sample Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test. As expected, it was found that car-sharing software has a significant negative impact on driving distraction and usability. The overall performance of young drivers is better than that of the elderly, but it seems that young drivers are more likely to be led to errors by car-sharing software. In most aspects, experienced drivers perform better than inexperienced drivers and have a better in-depth understanding of car-sharing software weaknesses. However, inexperienced drivers performed better regarding braking time and interaction time. Although young inexperienced drivers performed worst in driving safety, they exhibited the lowest cognitive load and the highest interaction efficiency. The experience of using car-sharing software may improve driver's ability to deal with driving distractions. The above conclusions provide theoretical support for optimizing the UX of car-sharing software and some references for driver's screening and training.

AB Autonomous vehicles are perhaps the most encountered element in a driving simulator. Their effect on the realism of the simulator is critical. For autonomous vehicles to contribute positively to the realism of the hosting driving simulator, they need to have a realistic appearance and, possibly more importantly, realistic behavior. Addressed is the problem of modeling realistic and humanlike behaviors on simulated highway systems by developing an abstract framework that captures the details of human driving at the microscopic level. This framework consists of four units that together define and specify the elements needed for a concrete humanlike driving model to be implemented within a driving simulator. These units are the perception unit, the emotions unit, the decision-making unit, and the decision-implementation unit. Realistic models of humanlike driving behavior can be built by implementing the specifications set by the driving framework. Four humanlike driving models have been implemented on the basis of the driving framework: (a) a generic normal driving model, (b) an aggressive driving model, (c) an alcoholic driving model, and (d) an elderly driving model. These driving models provide experiment designers with a powerful tool for generating complex traffic scenarios in their experiments. These behavioral models were incorporated along with three-dimensional visual models; and vehicle dynamics models into one entity, which is the autonomous vehicle. Subjects perceived the autonomous vehicles with the described behavioral models as having a positive effect on the realism of the driving simulator. The erratic driving models were identified correctly by the subjects in most cases.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate how a smart phone freight application service (Apps) could reduce CO2 emissions in road freight transport and to identify the core problems for improvements.
   Methods This research uses a multiple-case-study approach to examine several existing freight apps in the Chinese market. The study was conducted using multiple data collection techniques, including interviews, production observation, first-hand experience, and online-search summaries.
   Results Inspired by a full analysis of case studies, a hierarchical conceptual framework was developed to provide an over-arching view of how existing apps achieve environmental benefits, which deepens our understanding of the interrelationship between freight Apps utilization and CO2 reduction. Freight apps provide a mechanism that auto-match the consignor's demand and the carrier's supply based on mobile Internet. The efficient way to find the right truck and complete the delivery process enhances the decrease of truck's empty travel distances and improvement of average vehicle loaded, then leading to an improvement of efficiency and a decline in carbon emission in freight industry. And then the identification of returning pick-up and route planning was conducted to further improve apps for CO2 reduction.
   Conclusions The influences to freight movement system by apps focused on reconstructing the demand and supply with integration technology, and resulted in a more efficient transaction using matching technology and advanced fleet management with optimization technology. When with inter-urban Full Truck Load, freight apps enable carriers to search for demand for returning a pick-up with decreasing empty running mileages, which then has environmental benefits through reducing CO2 emissions. However, when in urban Less-than-Truck Load, by strengthening the average vehicle utilization on laden trips, another determinant of route planning of delivery & collection reduced CO2 emissions. In order to further promote development of apps, in inter-urban Full Truck Load of long-distance transport, sufficient number of users and suitable matching conditions ensured carriers schedule an order to guarantee the return pick-up at an appointed time or grab several orders to achieve a larger non-empty return trip. In this "always-laden" transport plan, consideration should be given to the carriers' search and waiting costs before starting the next freight service. Meanwhile, route planning of delivery & collection based on real-time traffic information in Less-than-Truck Load required sharing high-level of data, complicated-adaptable models and the efficient computing power. These valuable aspects would be a great challenge for follow-up development of freight apps in aiding CO2 emission reduction.

AB Driver distraction is a leading factor in car crashes. With a goal to reduce traffic accidents and improve transportation safety, this study proposes a driver distraction detection system which identifies various types of distractions through a camera observing the driver. An assisted driving testbed is developed for the purpose of creating realistic driving experiences and validating the distraction detection algorithms. The authors collected a dataset which consists of images of the drivers in both normal and distracted driving postures. Four deep convolutional neural networks including VGG-16, AlexNet, GoogleNet, and residual network are implemented and evaluated on an embedded graphic processing unit platform. In addition, they developed a conversational warning system that alerts the driver in real-time when he/she does not focus on the driving task. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline one which has only 256 neurons in the fully-connected layers. Furthermore, the results indicate that the GoogleNet is the best model out of the four for distraction detection in the driving simulator testbed.

AB This paper proposes a journey time estimator (JTE) to estimate the stochastic journey time of each path for performance assessment in road network with uncertainty due to day-to-day demand variations. The stochastic network framework is adopted in this paper, in which link flows and path journey times are modeled as random variables so as to fully utilize the first- and the second-order statistical properties of the partial data collected for the journey time estimation. The second-order statistical property is referred to the variance-covariance (var-cov) of the observed path journey times and link flows available for the estimation. In this paper, the proposed JTE is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. The objective of the upper-level problem is a variant of the Least Squares function, which considers the mean and var-cov of the observed path journey times. In addition, the observed statistical distribution of the link flow is also used to formulate a chance constraint in the upper-level problem. The lower-level problem is the reliability-based stochastic user equilibrium traffic assignment problem in stochastic network, which explicitly considers the reliability-based path choice behaviors of the road users under demand uncertainty. A heuristic iterative estimation-assignment algorithm is employed to solve the proposed hi-level problem. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the applications of the JTE and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The availability of advisory warnings via Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure communication in the connected environments is expected to gradually increase over the next few years. Much of the research on advisory warning systems have examined driving behaviour in response to unexpected driving hazards; however, very little research has been conducted on common driving interactions such as interacting with pedestrians at pedestrian crossings. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the connected environment on driving behaviour at pedestrian crossings. The connected environment was designed within the CARRS-Q advanced driving simulator. A combination of auditory (beep sound) and imagery message was simultaneously displayed on the windscreen to advise the driver on the presence of a pedestrian entering from a sidewalk. Seventy-eight licensed drivers drove the simulator in two driving conditions, namely, baseline and connected environment. The participants were 18-65 years old, and a third of them were females. Drivers' response to the driving aids and the braking behaviour were analysed in the latent response phase and the observable response phase, and the corresponding response times were modelled using the hazard-based duration modelling approach. In particular, this study applied the Weibull accelerated failure time model with shared frailty accounting for multiple observations from the same driver. Results showed that the time taken to respond to the pedestrian in the latent response phase was longer when the advisory warning was provided to the drivers, but the corresponding time in the observable response phase was shorter, indicating that drivers take an informed decision in the connected environment. Moreover, the safety margin-measured in terms of time-to-collision-was higher in the connected environment than the traditional driving environment, indicating a safer behavioural adaptation towards the connected environment.

AB The in-vehicle warning information provided in the CVs environment allow the driver to respond rapidly to upcoming hazardous situations. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety benefits due to the provision of warning information by analyzing vehicle interactions that are defined as the behavior change of the subject vehicle and the preceding vehicle. A notable feature of this study is the use of a multi-agent driving simulation (MADS) method to analyze the vehicle interaction with various vehicle pairs that are composed of the connected vehicle (CV) capable of receiving warning information and the regular vehicle (RV) that does not receive warning information. A total of four scenarios representing different vehicle pairs, which include CV-RV, RV-CV, CV-CV, and RV-RV, are evaluated in this study. The proposed analysis consists of four parts: the characteristics of subject vehicle maneuvering, variation of relative speed, evasive maneuvering by lane change, and overall crash potential. As an example, the result of analyzing crash potential index (CPI) showed that the greatest safety benefits were obtained with the CV-CV case among aforementioned four vehicle pairs. Approximately 45% of CPI reduction was achievable with the CV-CV case, compared to the RV-RV case. In addition to the CPI, useful findings obtained by investigating safety indicators for each vehicle pair are discussed in terms of safety benefits. The results of this study are expected to be used for both deriving valuable policies and developing more effective in-vehicle warning technologies to fully exploit the benefits of CVs.

AB Collaborative traffic-monitoring (CTM) systems exploit the location information continuously collected from vehicles. Location data are very sensitive information that made privacy a major obstacle for the widespread usage of CTM systems. The way how this data are generated and used is very important for users' privacy and data quality as well. Recently, two CTM approaches have been proposed, the first relies on a dedicated infrastructure that is called vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), and the second utilises the existing underlying infrastructure such as cellular and wireless networks. In this study, the authors propose a privacy aware collaborative traffic monitoring system (PA-CTM) that considers the privacy and security properties of VANETs and existing infrastructures. PA-CTM provides a client server architecture that relies on existing infrastructures and enhances privacy by: (i) Using a robust pseudonym providing system for anonymous access. Pseudonyms enable users to be authenticated anonymously by the traffic server without having their identities revealed. It also allows revealing identities for law enforcement purposes when necessary. Users are able to change their pseudonyms and hence hide their complete trajectory information form traffic server. (ii) Utilising a novel autonomous location update mechanism (ALUM) that does not rely on a trusted third party and uses only local parameters (speed and direction) for triggering a location update or pseudonym change. These performance results showed that ALUM is effective for traffic monitoring in terms of both privacy and utility.

AB The value of accessibility concepts is well-established in transportation literature, but so is the low adoption of accessibility-based instruments by practitioners. Based on the premise that leveraging accessibility concepts to address public involvement challenges could promote their adoption in planning practice, this research investigates mechanisms to promote social learning among participants in public workshops. Potential mechanisms of learning include specific tool-based interactions and how such interactions reinforce structures of learning such as alignment and imagination. This paper details iterative testing of these mechanisms with a tool called CoAXs (short for Collaborative ACCESSibility-based stakeholder engagement system), through focus groups and exploratory workshops. A mixed-methods analysis of the workshops supports the expectation that alignment and imagination correlate positively with social learning, as measured by reported teaming and dialog quality. Specific interactions with the accessibility-based features of CoAXs in turn correlate positively with alignment and imagination, at individual and group levels of analysis. These findings, while not robustly generalizable, suggest that effective targeted stakeholder engagement for public transport can be structured around collaborative accessibility mapping. Adoption for broader public participation requires further development, especially the incorporation of actual day-to-day experiences such as unreliable operations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB All drivers have individual ways of driving. Still, there are groups of drivers with more or less similar characteristics. In this research, 28 drivers from Chengdu city (P.R. China) participated in an experiment where car following behaviour was measured with GPS devices. In every measured trip there was a leading and following vehicle both equipped with a GPS device. Drivers are classified based on a Driver Behaviour Questionnaire and observed acceleration and deceleration behaviour. The result shows four distinct classes of drivers: macho drivers, careful/inexperienced drivers, smooth going/professional drivers, and experienced/fast drivers. Drivers in the different classes give different emission of air pollution and fuel consumption. Saturation flows are determined from the trajectories and vary between different driver types. The measured trajectories have been analysed in detail to determine some parameters for the Wiedemann 74 model. Most default parameters in the VISSIM program appear to be unsuited for the simulation of driving behaviour measured in the experiment. The emissions and fuel consumption calculated by a simulation model with default parameters are not consistent with the empirical data. The calibration done for different driver types shows that several model parameters are significantly different for the different driver classes.

AB Ground traffic lights are essential for maintaining traffic efficiency and safety at intersections. However, unsignallised intersections are still frequent in actual traffic environments. With the development of new forms of vehicular communication, in-vehicle traffic lights can assist drivers at unsignallised intersections. The authors proposed two types of in-vehicle traffic lights to assist drivers; these corresponded to two-way and all-way stop-controlled intersections. They adopted gap acceptance theory and a first-come-first-served strategy to determine passing priority for the two types of intersections, respectively. They then conducted a driving simulator experiment involving 23 participants, to investigate driver behaviours elicited by the proposed system. They prepared four experimental conditions with combinations of in-vehicle traffic lights and auditory warnings. The authors' experimental results indicated that in-vehicle traffic lights were associated with significantly longer post-encroachment times and a significantly shorter maximum brake stroke. In terms of eye-gaze behaviours, the percentage of gaze concentration to the road centre area and mean glance durations were deemed acceptable for the avoidance of visual distraction, when in-vehicle traffic lights were presented via a head-up display. Therefore, their analysis of driver behaviours indicates that in-vehicle traffic lights can effectively provide driver assistance at unsignallised intersections.

AB Intellectualisation is one of the three reforming technologies in automotive industry, which is now changing the mobility mode and human society. High safety and intelligence are the pre-requisites for putting self-driving vehicles into markets. This study presents the hardware and software architecture for intelligent vehicles, as well as their road verification in typical traffic scenarios. The hardware system includes environmental sensors, computing platforms, vehicle actuators, and vehicle platforms, which is able to provide redundant protection against the main controller failure. The software system includes environmental perception module, scene cognition module, decision and control module, human-computer interaction module and public service support module. To evaluate the performance of the developed architecture, the road tests of automated driving system were carried out in two typical traffic scenarios, including: (i) closed road test in Yuanboyuan region; (ii) open road test on Beijing-Tianjin highway. The real road test shows that the designed hardware and software systems for intelligent vehicles have desirable robustness, which can realise accurate and reliable environment perception, decision-making and motion control.

AB A signal control method considering platoon-based actuation is presented with a focus on its application to two arterial corridors in the Houston Metropolitan Area, where the signal coordination is required for adjacent intersections. For the purpose of immediate implementation, the system was developed based on existing conventional loop detectors and control technologies used by Texas Department of Transportation. Simply based on volume and occupancy - the only traffic information reported by a conventional loop detector, it is impossible to precisely detect a platoon of vehicle approaching an intersection. As a compromise way, two specific logics were proposed to switch the system between the original coordinated control and the new platoon-based actuated control systems. At one testbed suffering from large left-turn traffic, the results revealed by the detector data before and after the implementation show that the model works well to relieve the delay for both left-turn traffic and through traffic on the major road. On another testbed where the platoon-based control is activated only when the through traffic is not high, some improvements were also observed. This method opens the door of wide application of the platoon-based signal control system (simply based on conventional loop detectors) to arterial corridors.

AB Traffic sign detection and classification is a critical component of intelligent transportation systems, which is applied to inform automatic unmanned driving systems and driving assistance systems about conditions and limits of roads. Although computer vision is widely utilised in traffic sign detection, detection and recognising traffic signs globally remains a great challenge due to the variety of sign types, scale-variance and geometric variations. To address these problems, this study proposes a region-based deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for traffic sign detection and classification. Specifically, a multi-branch sample pyramid module is proposed, which is based on multi-branch CNNs for multi-scaled feature exaction. A limited deformable convolutional module is then embedded into the CNN layers to learn the distorted information representation for deformation handing. Moreover, a scale-aware multi-task region proposal network module is applied to detect traffic signs with various scales. The whole network is trained in an end-to-end manner. Finally, experiments are conducted on two public detection data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Traffic signs play a crucial role in regulating traffic and facilitating cautious driving. Automatic traffic sign recognition is one of the key tasks in autonomous driving. Accuracy in the classification of traffic signs is therefore very important for the navigation of a vehicle. Here, a reliable and robust convolutional neural network (CNN) is presented for classifying these signs. The proposed classifier is a weighted multi-CNN trained with a novel methodology. It achieves a near state-of-the-art recognition rate of 99.59% when tested on the German traffic sign recognition benchmark dataset. Compared to the existing classifiers, the proposed one is a low-complexity network that recognises a test image in 10ms when running on an NVIDIA 980 Ti GPU system. The results demonstrate its suitability and reliability in high-speed driving scenarios.

AB For vehicle safety, the in-time monitoring of the driver and assessing his/her state is a demanding issue. Frustration can lead to aggressive driving behaviours, which play a decisive role in up to one-third of fatal road accidents. Consequently, the authors present the automatic analysis of the emotional driver states of frustration, anxiety, positive and neutral. Based on experiments with normal drivers within cars in real-world (low expressivity) situations, they use speech data, as speech can be recorded with zero invasiveness and comes naturally in driving situations. A careful selection of speech features, subject data identification, hyper-parameter optimisation, and machine learning algorithms was applied for this difficult 4-emotion-class detection problem, where the literature hardly reports results above chance level. In-car assistance demands real-time computing. A very detailed analysis yields best results with relatively small random forests, and with an optimal feature set containing only 65 features (6.51% of the standardemobasefeature set) which outperformed all other feature sets, producing 35.38% unweighted average recall (53.26% precision) with low computational effort, and also reducing the inevitably high confusion of 'neutral' with low-expressed emotions. This result is comparable to and even outperforming other reported studies of emotion recognition in the wild. Their work, therefore, triggers adaptive automotive safety applications.

AB Acquiring real-time traffic information is a basic requirement for dynamic vehicular navigation systems. The majority of the current navigation systems are based on static traffic information. Building on mobile crowdsensing technology, the authors propose context-aware traffic estimation and navigation system (CANS), a context-aware system that can estimate traffic state without any requirement for expensive infrastructure. Using only available equipment, it can provide dynamic navigation service to drivers. The proposed system consists of three main components: local traffic estimation, global traffic aggregation, and navigation. In this system, vehicles estimate local traffic state using vehicular contextual information including speed and acceleration by relying on fuzzy logic, and transmit the information to the urban server. The server integrates the received local traffic information from different vehicles and estimates the global traffic state, providing the traffic-aware navigation system to drivers. CANS performance is evaluated for an urban scenario in a traffic flow in Birjand, Iran. The experiment is conducted for evaluating CANS in both traffic congestion estimation and navigation. The results show an accurate estimation of traffic states along urban roads. Compared with previous approaches, CANS overrides them for its reduced travel time.

AB The Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) have been proposed to avoid vehicular accidents by using the inter-vehicle cooperation mechanism, the real-time-based sharing of the road and traffic information, automatic controls of braking and acceleration and so on. Several critical challenges in ADAS are seldom discussed in related studies, including unstable driving in velocity or the road lane, driving assistance without driving path prediction, suddenly happening of human abnormal driving or mechanical vehicle accident and so on. Thus, this study proposes the Adaptive vehicle Collision Defence (ACD) system to minimise the driving threat under critical driving threats. The proposed ACD consists of three phases: the adaptive time-to-collision (TTC) determination phase, the threat probability analysis with colouring phase, and the threat avoidance phase. The main objectives are to minimise the driving threat probability and to achieve active safe driving for the advanced driver assistance systems. Numerical results indicate that the proposed ACD outperforms the compared approaches in TTC probability, driving threat probability, and region boundary.

AB In this study, a novel method is proposed to predict the traffic features in a long freeway corridor with a number of time steps ahead. The proposed method, on the basis of rolling self-structured traffic patterns, utilizes the growing hierarchical self-organizing map model to partition the unlabeled traffic patterns into an appropriate number of clusters and then develops the genetic programming model for each cluster to predict its corresponding traffic features. For demonstration, the proposed method is tested against a 110-km freeway stretch, on which 48 time steps of 5-min traffic flows are predicted (i.e., a 4-h prediction). The prediction accuracy of the proposed method is compared with other models (ARIMA, SARIMA, and naive models) and the results support the superiority of the proposed method. Further analyses indicate that applications of the proposed method to larger scale freeway networks require sufficient lengths of observation to acquire enough traffic patterns for training and validation in order to achieve higher prediction accuracy.

AB This study proposes a multi-mode switching longitudinal autonomous driving system based on model predictive control (MPC) with acceleration estimation of proceeding vehicle. A hierarchical control framework composed of three layers is utilised. In the first layer, five longitudinal driving scenarios are defined based on emergency degree. In the second layer, the MPC for longitudinal autonomous driving is designed and serving as the upper controller. Among which a non-linear tracking differentiator is used for acceleration estimation of preceding vehicle. In the third layer, the inverse longitudinal vehicle system dynamic model with strong non-linearity is considered in the lower controller. Proportional-integral-derivative feedback and feedforward control are combined to track the desired acceleration. Simulation and hardware-in-loop test results show that the multi-mode switching longitudinal autonomous driving system is feasible and effective, and has important value for engineering application.

AB Driver drowsiness is a frequent cause of traffic accidents. Research on driver drowsiness detection methods is important to improve road traffic safety. Previous driving fatigue detection methods frequently extracted single features such as eye or mouth changes and trained shallow classifiers, which limit the generalisation capability of these methods. This study proposes a framework for recognising driver drowsiness expression by using facial dynamic fusion information and a deep belief network (DBN) to address the aforementioned problem. First, the landmarks and textures of the facial region are extracted from videos captured using a high-definition camera. Then, a DBN is built to classify facial drowsiness expressions. Finally, the authors' method is tested on a driver drowsiness dataset, which includes different genders, ages, head poses and illuminations. Certain experiments are also carried out to investigate the effects of different facial subregions and temporal resolutions on the accuracy of driver fatigue recognition. Results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method, which has an average accuracy of 96.7%.

AB In this work both the multimodal hypergraph and the viable hyperpath conceptualizations are presented. The shortest viable hyperpath problem (SVHP) in a multimodal transportation network is defined. We consider a label correcting approach to find the shortest viable hyperpath from an origin to a destination, for different values of the upper limit of modal transfers. Such hyperpaths compose a Pareto-optimal set, from where the user could choose the "best" hyperpath according to personal preferences with respect to the expected travel time and the upper limit of modal transfers. An application example on a multimodal network is presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study proposes a deep learning framework for driver identity identification by extracting information from the vehicular controller area network (CAN) bus signals. First, naturalistic driving data of 20 drivers were collected under a fixed testing route with different road types and different traffic conditions. Then, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network was constructed for driver identification, which consists of two convolutional-pooling layers, a fully connected layer, and a SoftMax layer. Model optimisation algorithms were applied to improve accuracy and speed up the training process. Also, the model parameters were optimised by evaluating their influences on the model results. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed algorithm was compared with that of the K-nearest neighbour, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron, and long shortterm memory model. The authors used the Macro F1 score as an evaluation criterion and the identification score of the authors' proposed model reaches 99.10% under 20 testing subjects where the data time window size is one second and the sample data overlap is 80%. The results show that the model's performance is significantly better than the other algorithms, which can effectively identify driver identities with stability and robustness.

AB Automated lane detection is a vital part of driver assistance systems in intelligent vehicles. In this study, a multi-lane detection method based on omnidirectional images is presented to conquer the difficulties stemming from the limited view field of the rectilinear cameras. The contributions of this study are twofold. First, to extract the features of the lane markings under various illumination and road-surface scenarios, a feature extractor based on anisotropic steerable filter is proposed. Second, a parabola lane model is used to fit the straight as well as curved lanes. According to the parabola lane model, the straight lines and curves of feature maps can be represented as straight lines in a linear space coordinate system. Then lane modelling can be treated as an optimisation question in linear space and the parameters of lanes can be estimated by minimising the objection function. The method has been tested on publicly available data sets and the real car experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-arts approaches and obtains a detection accuracy of 99% in real world scenes.

AB The wide acceptance of bike sharing services depends on the consumers' continuing use of bike sharing services. Facilitating users' continuance intentions and retaining consumers are important to bike sharing service providers and governments. Following extended technology continuance theory and incorporating perceived risk, we aim to identify factors that affect bike sharing services' continuance intentions in this study. We use a questionnaire survey involving 559 respondents to conduct data analysis with structural equation modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the extended technology continuance theory could provide a strong rationale in the investigation of continuance intention to adopt bike sharing services. Perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and attitude are positively associated with continuance intention. Perceived usefulness also positively impacts satisfaction and attitude. Perceived risk tends to be negatively related to satisfaction. Additionally, confirmation can positively impact perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Perceived ease of use is positively associated with perceived usefulness and attitude.

ID ROUTE CHOICE MODEL
AB The objective of this work is the calibration of a generalised cost function for the bicycle network links to be used in conjunction with assignment methods for uncongested networks, as cyclists are generally much less delayed by traffic congestions with respect to auto-traffic. The calibration's goal is to find a coefficient vector for a linear link-cost function that maximises the overlap between routes obtained with a minimum cost routing of cyclists' demand and the relative cyclists' chosen routes, identified by a map-matching procedure of recorded global positioning system (GPS) traces. The calibration focuses on minimising an objective function through different established evolution-based optimisation algorithms, thus avoiding the generation of route choice sets. Link cost functions are calibrated for a modified Openstreet network of Bologna, Italy, using GPS data from the European cycling challenge and Bella Mossa campaign. Results show an improvement of up to 30% of overlapping routes with respect to pure distance-based routing. It is also demonstrated that the calibrated link-costs are transferable to a different scenario.

AB Accurately understanding driving behaviour is of crucial importance for advanced driving assistant systems such as adaptive cruise control system and intelligent forward collision warning system. To understand different driving styles, this study employs the clustering method and topic model to extract latent driving states, which can elaborate and analyse the commonness and individuality of driving behaviour characteristics with the longitudinal driving behaviour data collected by the instrumented vehicle. To handle the large set of data and discover the valuable knowledge, the data mining techniques including ensemble clustering method based on the kernel fuzzy C-means algorithm and the modified latent Dirichlet allocation model are employed in this study. The aggressive', cautious' and moderate' driving states are discovered and the underlying quantified structure is built for the driving style analysis.

AB Location verification has witnessed significant attention in vehicular communication due to the growth in number of location based intelligent transport system (ITS) applications. The traditional cryptography based techniques have been suggested to secure and verify location of vehicles. The traditional techniques increase protocol complexity and computational overhead due to the ad hoc nature of vehicular network environments. In this context, this study proposes two layered location information verification cum security (LIVES) technique based on transferable belief model (TBM). In layer 1, tiles based verification is performed using the concepts of virtual tiles on roads and received signal strength. In layer 2, TBM based verification is performed. Specifically, the belief of the presence of a vehicle on each tiles, and the belief of the presence of a vehicle as neighbour of other neighbouring vehicles are combined as collective belief to attest the location claim of a neighbour vehicle. The performance of LIVES is evaluated with road-based and map-based network environments. The single, mixed and multiple adversary vehicles are considered in both the network environments. The comparative performance evaluations attest the benefits of LIVES as compared with the verification and inference of position using anonymous beaconing and without using LIVES.

AB Existing day-to-day traffic assignment models are all built to capture day-to-day traffic fluctuations, but most of the evolution process itself and the final equilibrium state are based on the assumption of passengers' rational behavior, that is, to find the path with the minimum travel cost, which ignore the correlation among the days' evolution and boundedly rational (BR) of travelers in the path choice and thus can give very unreasonable results for ones with this behavior. Such an assumption basically ignores the correlation among day-to-day evolution and bounded rationality (BR) of travelers in the path choice and thus could result in inaccurate results for the travelers with such behavior. This paper proposes a day-to-day dynamic evolution model with the consideration of BR, which can better captures travelers' characteristics in the path finding within an urban railway network. In order to capture the correlation of path choice over time, we introduce a time series method, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), to analyze the complex long-term correlations hiding in the passengers' evolution over time. The study results clearly show that the proposed model and analytical approach is better for capture the day-to-day dynamics in travel behaviors and can serve as a general framework of modeling passengers' BR behavior.

AB Transportation networks are often subjected to perturbed conditions leading to traffic disequilibrium. Under such conditions, the traffic evolution is typically modeled as a dynamical system that captures the aggregated effect of paths-shifts by drivers over time. This paper proposes a day-to-day (DTD) dynamical model that bridges two important gaps in the literature. First, existing DTD models generally consider current path flows and costs, but do not factor the sensitivity of path costs to flow. The proposed DTD model simultaneously captures all three factors in modeling the flow shift by drivers. As a driver can potentially perceive the sensitivity of path costs with the congestion level based on past experience, incorporating this factor can enhance real-world consistency. In addition, it smoothens the time trajectory of path flows, a desirable property for practice where the iterative solution procedure is typically terminated at an arbitrary point due to computational time constraints. Second, the study provides a criterion to classify paths for an origin-destination pair into two subsets under traffic disequilibrium: expensive paths and attractive paths. This facilitates flow shifts from the set of expensive paths to the set of attractive paths, enabling a higher degree of freedom in modeling flow shift compared to that of shifting flows only to the shortest path, which is behaviorally restrictive. In addition, consistent with the real-world driver behavior, it also helps to preclude flow shifts among expensive paths. Improved behavioral consistency can lead to more meaningful path/link time-dependent flow profiles for developing effective dynamic traffic management strategies for practice. The proposed DTD model is formulated as the dynamical system by drawing insights from micro-economic theory. The stability of the model and existence of its stationary point are theoretically proven. Results from computational experiments validate its modeling properties and illustrate its benefits relative to existing DTD dynamical models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phone use during driving causes decrease in situation awareness and delays response to the events happening in driving environment which may lead to accidents. Reaction time is one of the most suitable parameters to measure the effect of distraction on event detection performance. Therefore, this paper reports the results of a simulator study which analysed and modelled the effects of mobile phone distraction upon reaction time of the Indian drivers belonging to three different age groups. Two different types of hazardous events: (1) pedestrian crossing event and (2) road, crossing event by parked vehicles were included for measuring drivers' reaction times. Four types of mobile phone distraction tasks: simple conversation, complex conversation, simple texting and complex texting were included in the experiment. Two Weibull AFT (Accelerated Failure Time) models were developed for the reaction times against both the events separately, by taking all the phone use conditions and various other factors (such as age, gender, and phone use habits during driving) as explanatory variables. The developed models showed that in case of pedestrian crossing event, the phone use tasks: simple conversation, complex conversation, simple texting and complex texting caused 40%, 95%, 137% and 204% increment in the reaction times and in case of road crossing event by parked vehicles, the tasks caused 48%, 65%, 121% and 171% increment in reaction times respectively. Thus all the phone use conditions proved to be the most significant factors in degrading the driving performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The extensive use of mobile phones has produced a massive amount of trajectory data and provided the possibility to conduct travel behaviour analyses. In this study, a method of travel behaviour analysis is proposed based on extensive trajectory data obtained from Didi Chuxing, China. The travel time regularity and traffic hot spots are analysed from spatial perspectives for three modes: workday, weekend, and the double 11 shopping festival modes. Then a network analysis of the travel hot spots is conducted to study the regularity of travel behaviours. In addition, the travel regularity has been studied and origin/destination prediction of the hot spots has been conducted based on the multivariate delta-long short-term memory model. The results indicate that the distribution of the travel time during peak hours and at the travel hot spots can effectively reflect the temporal travel regularity of residents. Additionally, the network can reflect the spatial travel regularity of residents. The results provide reference information for improving urban traffic control.

AB Fully controllable autonomous vehicles offer unprecedented opportunities to address the inefficiency associated with selfish routing, a fundamental issue in transportation network modeling. This study proposes a route control scheme that aims to strike a balance between gains in the system efficiency and the control intensity, defined as the demand flow under control for each origin-destination (OD) pair. The proposed model has a bi-level structure and is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). A specialized algorithm based on sensitivity analysis and the alternative direction method of multiplier (ADMM) is developed to find a local optimum for the MPEC. Results of numerical experiments show that (1) in all tested cases, controlling a minority of vehicles (less than 10% in some case) could bring the system very close to the system optimum; (2) some O-D pairs enjoy a higher control priority than the others, mostly due to the underlying network topology rather than the demand magnitude; (3) the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient; (4) starting from different initial solutions, the algorithm produces very similar local optimal solutions.

AB Lane-changing is one of the complex driving tasks that depends on the number of vehicles, ob-jectives, and lanes. A driver often needs to respond to a lane-changing request of a lane-changer, which is a function of their personality traits and the current driving conditions. A connected environment is expected to assist during the lane-changing decision-making process by increasing situational awareness of surrounding traffic through vehicle-to-vehicle communication and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. Although the majority of lane-changing decision -making components (e.g., gap acceptance behaviour, lane-changing execution behaviour, and drivers' response to a heavy vehicle) in a traditional environment (an environment without driving aids) has been frequently investigated, our understanding of drivers' interactions during the lane changing decision-making process in a connected environment remains elusive due to the novelty of a connected environment and the scarcity of relevant data. As such, this study examines drivers' responses to lane-changing requests in a connected environment using the CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator. Seventy-eight participants responded to the lane-changing request of a lane-changer under two randomised driving conditions: baseline (traditional environment without driving aids) and connected environment (with driving aids). A segmentation-based approach is employed to extract drivers' responses to the lane-changing request and subsequently estimate their response time from trajectory data. Additionally, drivers' response times are modelled using a random parameter accelerated failure time (AFT) hazard-based duration model. Results reveal that drivers tend to be more cooperative in response to a lane-changing request in the connected environment compared with the baseline condition whereby they tend to accelerate to avoid the lane-changing request. The AFT model suggests that on average drivers' response times are shorter in the connected environment, implying that drivers respond to the lane-changing request faster in the presence of driving aids. However, at the individual level, connected environment's impact on drivers' response times is mixed as drivers' response times may increase or decrease in the connected environment compared to the baseline condition, for instance, we find that female drivers have lower response times in the connected environment than that of male drivers. Overall, this study finds that drivers in connected environment, on average, take less time to respond and appear to be more cooperative, and thus, are less likely to be engaged in safety-critical events.

AB This study evaluates the effectiveness of using detailed cellular network signalling data for travel time estimation and route classification. Here, the authors propose a processing pipeline for estimating travel times and route classification based on Cell ID and received signal strength (RSS) measurements from a cellular network. The pipeline combines cellular fingerprinting, particle filtering, integrity monitoring, and map matching based on a hidden Markov model (HMM). The method is evaluated using a dataset of 11,000 cellular RSS measurements with corresponding GPS locations for the city of Norrkoping, Sweden. The basic fingerprinting method has a CEP-67 location accuracy of 111 m and both particle filtering and integrity monitoring improved the results: 79 and 38 m for particle filtering and particle filtering with integrity monitoring, respectively. The route classification method resulted in a precision of 0.83 and a recall of 0.92, which are clear improvements compared to basic map matching of fingerprinting estimates. This new type of noise-adaptive travel time sampling in combination with an HMM-based route classification shows promising results and can potentially support large-scale estimates of both route choice and travel times using detailed cellular network signalling data in urban areas.

AB We propose a bi-level network design model comprising automated vehicle (AV) links and congestion pricing to improve traffic congestion. As upper-level road planners strive to minimize total travel-time costs by optimizing both the network design and the congestion pricing, lower-level travelers make choices about their routes to minimize their individual travel costs. Our proposed model integrates a network design and congestion pricing to improve traffic congestion and we use a relaxation-based method to solve the model. We conducted a series of numerical tests to analyze the proposed model and solution method. Our results indicate that network design is more effective than congestion pricing when the AV market penetration is high and the opposite is true when AV penetration is low. More importantly, we find that a network design of automated vehicle links with congestion pricing is superior to a single network design or congestion pricing, especially when both AVs and conventional vehicles have a relatively large market penetration .

AB Conventional automatic headlight devices determine whether to switch vehicle headlights on or off according to the brightness of the environment. These devices cannot automatically switch on headlights during daytime unless the headlights are required in specific road conditions (e.g. mountainous or foggy areas), thus compromising the safety of road users and drivers. This study develops a light-emitting diode (LED) headlight system that integrates the global positioning system (GPS) and a controller area network (CAN) bus communication interface. This system uses the GPS system to analyse the geographic location and then determines whether to switch on the LED headlight. To reduce the system complexity, a CAN bus is used to limit the number of control wires required. The LED headlight driver also uses an interleaved boost converter that has low conduction losses and input ripple currents, which improves the conversion efficiency of the headlight drivers and extends the battery lifetime. The feasibility of the proposed technology is verified using experimental results.

AB Perceived mean-excess travel time is a new risk-averse route choice criterion recently proposed to simultaneously consider both stochastic perception error and travel time variability when making route choice decisions under uncertainty. The stochastic perception error is conditionally dependent on the actual travel time distribution, which is different from the deterministic perception error used in the traditional logit model. In this paper, we investigate the effects of stochastic perception error at three levels: (1) individual perceived travel time distribution and its connection to the classification by types of travelers and trip purposes, (2) route choice decisions (in terms of equilibrium flows and perceived mean-excess travel times), and (3) network performance measure (in terms of the total travel time distribution and its statistics). In all three levels, a curve fitting method is adopted to estimate the whole distribution of interest. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate and visualize the above analyses. The graphical illustrations allow for intuitive interpretation of the effects of stochastic perception error at different levels. The analysis results could enhance the understanding of route choice behaviors under both (subjective) stochastic perception error and (objective) travel time uncertainty. Some suggestions are also provided for behavior data collection and behavioral modeling.

AB A discrete dynamical system model, called a discrete rational adjustment process (DRAP), is built upon link-based variables to characterize the process of achieving equilibrium from a non-equilibrium state in traffic networks. The equilibrium state can be in either a deterministic or a stochastic user equilibrium state. The DRAP is formulated in a general framework with either fixed or elastic demand. Several mathematical properties of the DRAP are presented, including the invariance of its evolutionary trajectory, the equivalence between its stationary state and user equilibrium, the uniqueness of its stationary state, and its convergence. Proper toll schemes can make the DRAP evolve towards a system optimum state. Numerical experiments are carried out to show application of the DRAP and its properties and the effectiveness of toll schemes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous research has shown that urgent auditory warnings are likely to annoy drivers. Increased urgency could also raise drivers' stress levels, which in turn could impact their ability to detect and react to subsequent changes in the traffic environment. The authors conducted a simulator experiment with 24 truck drivers to investigate the potential of urgent alarms to raise annoyance and negatively affect drivers' subsequent responses to unrelated, critical events on the road. The drivers received two types of warnings that were designed to significantly differ in perceived urgency. Several times in the trial, an unexpected event occurred just seconds after drivers were presented with an unrelated warning, and the drivers had to brake immediately to avoid a collision. The results indicate that acoustic characteristics and semantic meaning may impact the perceived annoyance of in-vehicle warnings. Interestingly, the authors found a significant, negative correlation between the drivers' experience (years of truck driving experience) and the rated annoyance for both types of warnings. Also, the drivers who received the high-urgency warning braked significantly harder and tended to brake later than the drivers who received a low-urgency warning. These results have implications for ITS systems for heavy vehicles that intend to implement auditory warning signals.

AB This study presents a three-lane highway overtaking strategy for an automated vehicle, which is based on a heuristic planning reinforcement learning algorithm. The proposed decision-making controller focuses on keeping the autonomous vehicle operating safely and efficiently. First, the modelling of the overtaking driving scenario is introduced and the reference approaches named intelligent driver model and minimise overall braking induced by lane changes are formulated. Second, the Dyna-H algorithm, which combines the modified Q-learning algorithm with a heuristic planning policy, is utilised for highway overtaking decision-making. Three different heuristic strategies are formulated to improve learning efficiency and compare performance. This algorithm is applied to determine the lane change and speed selection for an ego vehicle in the environment with uncertainties. Finally, the performance of Dyna-H is estimated in the autonomous overtaking scenario by comparing it with the reference and traditional learning methods. Furthermore, the Dyna-H-enabled decision-making strategies are validated and analysed in an open-sourcing driving dataset. Results prove that the proposed decision-making strategy could produce superior performance in convergence rate and control.

ID SIMULATION
AB A gated branch neural network (GBNN) is proposed for modelling mandatory lane changing (MLC) behaviour at the on-ramps of highways. It provides a core algorithm for an MLC suggestion system for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), where the main challenge is the trade-off between computational speed and prediction accuracy for both non-merge and merge events. The GBNN algorithm employs a gated branch based on correlation analysis, scaled exponential linear units activation function, and adaptive moment estimation optimiser. The algorithm has been evaluated using the real-world dataset of U.S. Highway 101 and Interstate 80 from Federal Highway Administration's Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM). Input features are extracted from NGSIM and pre-processed by standardisation and principal component analysis. TensorFlow framework and Python are used as the development platform. Results show that the proposed GBNN algorithm with the Pearson correlation method has values of 97.7%, 96.3%, and 0.990 for non-merge accuracy, merge accuracy, and receiver operating characteristic score, respectively. It outperforms other traditional binary classifiers for MLC applications, and is more light-weight than a convolutional neural network (AlexNet) of deep learning algorithm. Owing to its compact architecture, the GBNN provides high accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating promising usage as an MLC suggestion system in ADAS.

ID BEHAVIOR; SAFETY
AB Driving emotion is considered as driver's psychological reaction to a change in traffic environment, which affects driver's cognitive, judgement and behaviour. In anxiety, drivers are more likely to get engaged in distracted driving, increasing the likelihood of vehicle crash. Therefore, it is essential to identify driver's anxiety during driving, to provide a basis for driving safety. This study used multiple-electrocardiogram (ECG) feature fusion to recognise driver's emotion, based on back-propagation network and Dempster-Shafer evidence method. The three features of ECG signals, the time-frequency domain, waveform and non-linear characteristics were selected as the parameters for emotion recognition. An emotion recognition model was proposed to identify drivers' calm and anxiety during driving. The results show after ECG evidence fusion, the proposed model can recognise drivers' emotion, with an accuracy rate of 91.34% for calm and 92.89% for anxiety. The authors' findings of this study can be used to develop the personalised driving warning system and intelligent human-machine interaction in vehicles. This study would be of great theoretical significance and application value for improving road traffic safety.

AB Transport, particularly private vehicle use, contributes a disproportionately large amount to the degradation of the environment. Although advancements in energy production and vehicular technologies are critical for abatement, behaviour change will also have to be seen, hence the requirement for the application of Ergonomics. This review article aims to bring together various strands of research, including the effect of the design of a technological object on behaviour, the inter-related nature of goals and feedback in guiding performance, the effect on fuel economy of different driving styles and the various challenges brought by hybrid and electric vehicles, including range anxiety, workload and distraction, complexity and novelty. Finally, it is argued that Ecological Interface Design, in presenting the constraints of the system to the driver, is well suited to deal with the novelty of the low-carbon vehicle, supports the development of accurate mental-models of the system, and can be used for the design of in-vehicle interfaces that encourage energy-conserving driving behaviours while minimising distraction and workload, thus ensuring safety.

AB Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) in Intelligent and Connected Vehicles (ICVs) has drawn great attention in recent years due to its potentially significant positive impacts on the automotive revolution and travel experience. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth review of HMI in ICVs. Firstly, research and application development status are pointed out through the discussion on the cutting-edge technology classification, achievements, and challenges of the HMI technologies in ICVs, including recognition technology, multi-dimensional human vehicle interface, and emerging in-vehicle intelligent units. Then, the human factors issues of ICVs are discussed from three aspects: ICV acceptance, interaction quality of ICVs, and user experience of ICVs. Besides, based on the interaction technology and the mapping of the above issues, we conducted a visual analysis of the literature to realize the reflective thinking of the current HMI in ICVs. Finally, the challenges of HMI technology in ICVs are summarized. Moreover, the promising future opportunities are proposed from three aspects: utility optimization, experience reconfiguration, and value acquisition, to gaining insight into advanced and pleasant HMI in ICVs.

AB New developments in transportation systems and the increasing complexities of urban living are creating challenges and opportunities to comprehensively address transportation problems. The key to exploiting new opportunities lies in understanding how travelers would respond to changes in the transportation system. This study aims to understand traveler behavior under normal and unexpected travel conditions in real-life situations. The results of a comprehensive behavioral survey conducted in Brussels are reported. Commuters' mode, departure time and route selection decisions, and the factors that influence them, including travel conditions, personal and household characteristics, and situational constraints, are explored. The paper develops a deeper understanding of automobile commuters' response to adverse weather. Automobile commuters constitute more than 50% of the total sample (N = 1218). They were asked about adverse weather impacts on their mode, route and departure time changes. Among those who changed their travel decisions in adverse weather (about 50%), more than one-quarter reported that adverse weather was either very important or important in changing their mode; and 60% changed their departure time due to adverse weather whereas 35% diverted to alternate routes. Furthermore, close to 75% kept themselves informed about weather through secondary information sources such as radio and television. To analyze relationships empirically, ordered probit models of mode and departure time were estimated. The models show that commuters change their travel patterns in systematic ways when adverse weather occurs. Finally, the implications of the survey results for dealing with adverse weather problems are discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Cooperative intelligent transportation system (C-ITS) allows to improve safety of vehicles through communications between vehicles and infrastructure. C-ITS may also improve the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), but work on this issue is still in an early stage. ITS-G5 (IEEE 802.11p), the main technology for vehicle-to-vehicle time-critical communications, allows to deliver safety information over a rather long range with low latency, but obstacles in the link path and a large amount of vehicles sending at the same time may reduce performance. In this study, the authors assess and optimise the performance of ITS-G5 for time-critical safety conflict scenarios between vehicles and VRUs. The authors have tested various non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios in urban environments and line-of-sight (LOS) simulations to support C-ITS message prioritisation and scalability with different amount of vehicles. Example use cases with NLOS include pedestrians crossing streets from behind objects, and low-visibility scenarios, e.g. when VRU is behind a vehicle, behind a queue of vehicles, between vehicles, behind trees/bushes or behind a building. The LOS simulations utilise fuzzy weighted queueing mechanism for congestion control to overcome the packet losses and for data prioritisation. Based on these results, the applicability of ITS-G5 for VRU applications is assessed and performance improved.

AB This study presents a radar-based predictive kinetic energy management (PKEM) framework that is applicable as an add-on driver assistance module for a heavy vehicle with an internal combustion engine powertrain. The proposed framework attempts to minimise fuel consumption by estimating the motion of the leading vehicle from radar information and optimising the inputs to the ego vehicle in a predictive manner. The PKEM framework consists of a driver-pedal pre-filter, an interacting multiple model radar-based filter and predictor of traffic object states, and a non-linear model predictive controller. The framework is integrated with established human-driver car-following models representing various driving styles and evaluated over a set of standardised driving cycles. The authors found that the energy-saving benefits can be as much as 23% over the baseline driver-only case with minimal compromises on travel time in urban environments, while the benefits are nearly negligible on the highway cycle. The results included also show the potential trade-offs in accommodating driver-desired inputs.

AB In this paper, the traffic equilibriums for mixed traffic flows of human-driven vehicles (HDV) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) under a tradable credit scheme (TCS) are established and formulated as two variational inequality (VI) problems with exogenous and endogenous CAV penetration rate, respectively. A modified Lagrangian dual (MLD) method embedded with a revised Smith's route-swapping (RSRS) algorithm is proposed to solve the problems. Based on the numerical analysis, the impacts of CAV penetration and the extra expense of using a CAV on network performance are investigated. A novel driveway management, autonomous vehicle/credit charge (AVCC) link, is put forward to improve the efficiency of TCS. Under the TCS with exogenous CAV penetration rate, a logit-based model is applied to describe the stochastic user equilibrium for mixed traffic flow. It is found that the penetration of CAV gives rise to a better network performance and it can be further improved by the deployment of AVCC link. Under the TCS with endogenous penetration rate, a nested-logit model is applied to describe travelers' choices of vehicle types and routes. It is found that the deployment of AVCC links can slow down the decline rate of CAV penetration with increasing expense and thus ensure a lower average travel time for CAVs. In both cases, the deployment of AVCC links can stimulate credit trading and drop down its unit price.

AB This paper proposes a new modeling approach for network-wide on-line travel time estimation with inconsistent data from multiple sensor systems. It makes full use of both the available data from multiple sensor systems (on-line data) and historical data (off-line data). The first- and second-order statistical properties of the on-line data are investigated together with the data inconsistency issue to estimate network-wide travel times. The proposed model is formulated as a generalized least squares problem with non-linear constraints. A solution algorithm based on the penalty function method is adopted to solve the proposed model, whose application is illustrated by numerical examples using a local road network in Hong Kong.

AB The need to understand the effects of diverting traffic is emphasized by growing congestion and delays. This paper examines incident-induced diversion behavior by using loop-detector data and incident records on a freeway in Virginia. This work diverges from previous studies by (1) addressing both existence of diversion and its magnitude, (2) relying on field data rather than surveys, and (3) statistically relating diversion behavior and magnitude to quantifiable incident characteristics and traffic conditions. A dynamic programming-based procedure is used to identify diversions by isolating transient level shifts, and the diversions are associated with incident and traffic characteristics and variable message sign (VMS) displays through a binary logit model. The magnitude of the diversion is statistically related to traffic conditions via a linear regression model. The models indicate that the probability of triggering a diversion increases when an incident lasts longer, more general-purpose lanes are blocked, and speeds are lower. The results on the effects of trip purpose/time and information availability are consistent with previous studies. The magnitude of the diversion, measured by diversion rate, is related to instant traffic flow characteristics, general traffic demand considerations, and the incident characteristics.

AB Social media analytics is very critical in modem supply chain operations management (SCOM). However, in terms of methods, conducting social media analytics (SMA) for SCOM faces many challenges. Problems such as data accuracy (e.g., fake data), user privacy, data security, etc. are all present. Recently, with the emergence of blockchain technology (BCT), many new social media apps and platforms are developed. Motivated by the fact that (i) SMA is important for SCOM, (ii) the traditional social media (TSM) has insufficiency, and (iii) the "blockchain technology supported social media" (BSM) platforms have emerged, we explore whether and how the BSM would enhance social media analytics for SCOM. To be specific, by reviewing papers published in leading SCOM journals, we identify the applications and limitations of SMA for SCOM. Then, we conduct real case studies to examine the shortcomings of the TSM platforms and reveal features of their BSM counterparts. We investigate how the blockchain technology would potentially improve the use of SMA for SCOM. Finally, a future research agenda is proposed,

AB This study proposes an integrated eco-driving controller, in which speed profile and power split optimisation are simultaneously treated. A speed profile controller is designed based on a multi-phase dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, which is utilised to optimise speed trajectories with the detailed model of the traction power system, vehicle dynamics system, and signal constraints at intersections. The optimised speed and demand power profiles are designed as the reference of the power split optimal controller. A DP algorithm is presented to determine voltage trajectories of supercapacitors with power plant voltage limitations and dynamic power losses. The performance of the proposed integrated method is evaluated by numerical simulation based on an actual route of Chengdu Tramway Line 2. The energy reduction can be achieved by the speed profiles controller, compared to the eco-cruising benchmark strategies. Energy efficiency can be further improved by the integrated eco-driving controller. Moreover, the influences of green signal time windows and trip time on the shape of the optimised solution are investigated. For a given journey, the trip time with minimum energy consumption can be obtained. The integrated eco-driving control method can be implemented by driver assistant systems or automatic train operation systems.

AB This paper presents a novel idealised dynamical model of day to day traffic re-routeing (as traffic seeks cheaper routes) and proves a stability result for this dynamical model. (The dynamical model is based on swapping flow between paired alternative segments (these were introduced by Bar-Gera (2010)) rather than between routes.) It is shown that under certain conditions the dynamical system enters a given connected set of approximate equilibria in a finite number of days or steps. This proof allows for saturation flows which act as potentially active flow constraints. The dynamical system involving paired alternative segment swaps is then combined with a novel green-time-swapping rule; this rule swaps green-time toward more pressurised signal stages. It is shown that if (i) the delay formulae have a simple form and (ii) the "pressure" formula fits the special control policy P-0 (see Smith, 1979a,b), then the combined flow-swapping/green-time-swapping dynamical model also enters a given connected set of approximate consistent equilibria in a finite number of steps. Computational results confirm, in a simple network, the positive P0 result and also show, on the other hand, that such good behaviour may not arise if the equisaturation control policy is utilised. The dynamical models described here do not represent blocking back effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper develops a theoretical approach to identify optimal traffic routing strategy for managing transportation systems. It obtains the optimal traffic diversion ratio to each route that can be achieved in real time through cutting-edge sensing and vehicle-infrastructure communication technologies. We minimize the expected total travel time of all travelers in the network by providing and updating routing advice (or incentives) to travelers in real time. The system-optimum traffic routing problem is modeled using the stochastic control approach where demand uncertainty and travelers' heterogeneity are explicitly considered over time. The approach is generic in the sense that the optimal routing strategies can be achieved through various technologies, such as connected vehicle technologies, navigation systems, variable message signs, dynamic pricing, etc. For a two-route representative network, we use dynamic programming to derive and approximate the analytical solution of the optimal routing policy for each time interval. The optimal diversion ratio can be updated solely upon the traffic counts measured along the preferred route in real time. The general rule is, with a high probability, to minimize the congestion and keep the maximum flow performance on the preferred route from the beginning of the peak hours. Towards the end of the peak hours, the optimal policy would allow more intensive use of the preferred route resulting over-saturation, whereas keeping the minimal use of the alternative route. The analytical solution is validated and examined in a synthesized network and a real-world network in California. It is found that it consistently outperforms the deterministic solution, and its resultant system performance is also reasonably close to the benchmark system optimum where true demand could be precisely known one day ahead.

This paper aims to present a state-of-the-art on the main research issues of multi-stakeholder collaboration in urban transport and address the main contributions of the Special Issue on Collaboration and Urban Transport to the field. To that end, it seems necessary to identify and address the complexity of the relations of the stakeholders in the field, beyond the traditional classification of private and public stakeholders. A functional classification of urban stakeholders related to the different land uses is proposed a refer to space users and space organizers, each with several sub-categories. Furthermore, the collaboration among those stakeholders can take different forms and can be developed at different levels: transactional, informational and decisional. Thus, the main research topics regarding multi-stakeholders' collaboration are defined as: partnerships, resource sharing, resource pooling and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) systems. A set of papers in this special issue focus on Urban Consolidation Centres (UCCs), partnerships in transport under a general perspective, multi-stakeholder cooperation and its barriers, collaborative decision-making, traffic prediction and urban congestion. In the papers, which deal with the field of multi-stakeholder collaboration in urban transport, there is a predominance on the use of surveys, but also a focus on data-driven techniques. As a result, this special issue contributes not only to the theoretical aspects, but adds value to technical and methodological issues.

AB This article develops a utilitarian model that captures the effects of different forms of information and communication technologies (ICT) on accessibility. The role of constraints that an individual may face when making decisions is explicitly considered, as well as the presence of uncertainty. Two major forms of ICT are considered: travel information provided by ICT and teleactivities that may be performed using the ICT. The model is developed to measure the combined effects of both travel information and teleactivities as well as their potential interaction effects on accessibility. Numerical examples show the plausibility of the model in capturing the effects of different forms of ICT on accessibility and reflect the combined effects of travel information and teleactivities on accessibility in different situations.

AB Driving style recognition plays a crucial role in eco-driving, road safety, and intelligent vehicle control. This study proposes a statistical-based recognition method to deal with driver behaviour uncertainty in driving style recognition. First, the authors extract discriminative features using the conditional kernel density function to characterise path-following behaviour. Meanwhile, the posterior probability of each selected feature is computed based on the full Bayesian theory. Second, they develop an efficient Euclidean distance-based method to recognise the path-following style for new input datasets at a low computational cost. By comparing the Euclidean distance of each pair of elements in the feature vector, then they classify driving styles into seven levels from normal to aggressive. Finally, they employ a cross-validation method to evaluate the utility of their proposed approach by comparing with a fuzzy logic (FL) method. The experiment results show that the proposed statistical-based recognition method integrating with the kernel density is more efficient and robust than the FL method.

AB This study presents a multi-objective optimization model for the urban electric transit network problem with the aim of simultaneously designing the layout of bus routes, the frequency and the location and size of charging stations by making a tradeoff between two inconsistent objectives from the perspectives of passengers and operators. A Pareto artificial fish swarm algorithm (PAFSA) embedded with the genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to solve the proposed model. The PAFSA is designed to iteratively search for the proper network configuration satisfying two conflicting objectives. During which, the demand assignment with real-time transit information is performed to update the frequency of each newly designed route. The GA embedded into the PAFSA iteratively decides the locations of charging stations and the number of chargers to be installed in each charging station. A case study of the transit network in an urban region of a city in China is implemented, revealing that the proposed approach is able to rationally design a relatively large-scaled transit network with searching for the best fits between two inconsistent objectives.

AB We extend activity routing problems to consider 'needs' satisfaction over multiple days using an inventory routing problem concept. The resulting inventory-based selective household activity routing problem allows activity type choice, duration choice, activity destination choice, departure time, and scheduling of activities, all within space-time-needs constraints. A Lagrangian relaxation-based algorithm is proposed to solve the model for multiple days. A computational study is conducted. The model can measure several effects: heterogeneity in impacts of travel time changes on different days; the use of dual price as a threshold when needs play a role in the utility maximisation objectives; the possibility for activity participation consolidation due to increased travel time; and non-uniform impacts of travel time increase on utilities across a heterogeneous population. Comparison of the algorithm's performance against a commercial package showed average objective values that differed by only 1.8% or less.

AB Most deterministic day-to-day traffic evolution models, either in continuous-time or discrete time space, have been formulated based on a fundamental assumption on driver route choice rationality where a driver seeks to maximize her/his marginal benefit defined as the difference between the perceived route costs. The notion of rationality entails the exploration of the marginal decision rule from economic theory, which states that a rational individual evaluates his/her marginal utility, defined as the difference between the marginal benefit and the marginal cost, of each incremental decision. Seeking to analyze the marginal decision rule in the modeling of deterministic day-to-day traffic evolution, this paper proposes a modeling framework which introduces a term to capture the marginal cost to the driver induced by route switching. The proposed framework enables to capture both benefit and cost associated with route changes. The marginal cost is then formulated upon the assumption that drivers are able to predict other drivers' responses to the current traffic conditions, which is adopted based on the notion of strategic thinking of rational players developed in behavior game theory. The marginal cost based on 1-step strategic thinking also describes the "shadow price" of shifting routes, which helps to explain the behavioral tendency of the driver perceiving the cost-sensitivity to link/route flows. After developing a formulation of the marginal utility day-to-day model, its theoretical properties are analyzed, including the invariance property, asymptotic stability, and relationship with the rational behavioral adjustment process.

AB This paper develops an integrated model to characterize the market penetration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban transportation networks. The model explicitly accounts for the interplay among the AV manufacturer, travelers with heterogeneous values of travel time (VOTT), and road infrastructure capacity. By making in-vehicle time use more leisurely or productive, AVs reduce travelers' von. In addition, AVs can move closer together than human-driven vehicles because of shorter safe reaction time, which leads to increased road capacity. On the other hand, the use of AV technologies means added manufacturing cost and higher price. Thus, traveler adoption of AVs will trade VOTT savings with additional out-of-pocket cost. The model is structured as a leader (AV manufacturer)-follower (traveler) game. Given the cost of producing AVs, the AV manufacturer sets AV price to maximize profit while anticipating AV market penetration. Given an AV price, the vehicle and routing choice of heterogeneous travelers are modeled by combining a multinomial logit model with multi-modal multi-class user equilibrium (UE). The overall problem is formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC), which is challenging to solve. We propose a solution approach based on piecewise linearization of the MPCC as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and solving the MILP to global optimality. Non-uniform distribution of breakpoints that delimit piecewise intervals and feasibility-based domain reduction are further employed to reduce the approximation error brought by linearization. The model is implemented in a simplified Singapore network with extensive sensitivity analyses and the Sioux Falls network. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the solution approach and yield valuable insights about transportation system performance in a mixed autonomous/human driving environment.

AB Through relaxing the behavior assumption adopted in Smith's model (Smith, 1984), we propose a discrete dynamical system to formulate the day-to-day evolution process of traffic flows from a non-equilibrium state to an equilibrium state. Depending on certain preconditions, the equilibrium state can be equivalent to a Wardrop user equilibrium (UE), Logit-based stochastic user equilibrium (SUE), or boundedly rational user equilibrium (BRUE). These equivalence properties indicate that, to make day-to-day flows evolve to equilibrium flows, it is not necessary for travelers to choose their routes based on actual travel costs of the previous day. Day-to-day flows can still evolve to equilibrium flows provided that travelers choose their routes based on estimated travel costs which satisfy these preconditions. We also show that, under a more general assumption than the monotonicity of route cost function, the trajectory of the dynamical system converges to a set of equilibrium flows by reasonably setting these parameters in the dynamical system. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the application and properties of the dynamical system. The study is helpful for understanding various processes of forming traffic jam and designing an algorithm for calculating equilibrium flows. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper analyzes how a central agent may bring a mixed traffic system including both human-driven and autonomous vehicles to an equilibrium that both maximizes the efficiency and is stable under the control. The evolution of the human drivers' route choices, as well as the agent's control measures, is described using a joint day-to-day (DTD) dynamical model based on probability route choice. Within this setting, we show that (1) the fixed point of the proposed dynamical system coincides with the unique mixed equilibrium, and (2) the system is asymptotically stable in continuous time, namely it always converges to the mixed equilibrium from a given initial state. We then examine how alternative control policies may affect the transition trajectory leading to the mixed equilibrium. Two alternative control schemes are proposed and analyzed. The first, referred to as the stability-first control, aims to stabilize a given disequilibrium as soon as possible. The second seeks to minimize the total system cost accumulated over the transition period, hence called the efficiency-first control. We propose a continuous time optimal control formulation for both schemes and discuss how the formulation can be discretized and solved to local optimality using existing algorithms. Numerical experiments conducted on two illustrative examples highlight the differences among the three control schemes and how the share of autonomous vehicles affects the tradeoff between the efficiency and stability of the mixed traffic system.
